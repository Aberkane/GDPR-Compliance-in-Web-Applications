Much later, in conjunction with Ray Ozzie's Iris Associates, Lotus also released a groupware and email system, Lotus Notes. IBM purchased the company in 1995 for $3.5 billion, primarily to acquire Lotus Notes and to establish a presence in the increasingly important client-server computing segment, which was rapidly making host-based products like IBM's OfficeVision obsolete.

Areas of activity include: --FairPay - An entirely new concept of what a price is and why -- an architecture for efficiently pricing digital content/services in the context of an ongoing relationship. FairPay is based on customer dialogs about value, and develops a buyer reputation based on Internet feedback, to go beyond ""freemium,"" to a far more efficient and dynamically adaptive hybrid of free and paid offerings.  FairPay was presented 12/1/11 at an MIT Enterprise Forum of NYC symposium on ""Better Strategies for Monetizing Digital Offerings,"" and on the HBR Blog on 11/18/13. Teleshuttle is working on a pro-bono basis with industry and academic partners on research, trials, and applications of FairPay, and offers free consultation services.   --CoTV - Coactive TV – provides a rich platform for the growing trend toward multi-screen viewing and simultaneous, or “coactive,” use of TV and the Web.  CoTV creates a powerful new compound medium that fully maintains the best of both (and works with ordinary TVs and PCs/tablets/phones as companion devices) – while riding the trend toward user-centered media multitasking in the wireless, networked home.  Fifteen Reisman CoTV-related patents have issued, with more allowed or pending.  These patents were licensed to RPX Corporation member companies as of 3/10/15.   --Search and the Social Web and Semantic Web (Sold) - A portfolio including seven patents issued in 2005-2014, with others pending.  Sold 7/6/09 to RPX Corporation, the first defensive patent aggregator.     --Internet push distribution and software update (Sold) - In the early 1990s, Teleshuttle developed a patent portfolio that was later licensed to BTG International for commercialization.  This portfolio includes nineteen patents awarded in 1997-2014.  BTG's licensing efforts led to patent infringement suits against Microsoft and Apple. On 3/31/06, BTG announced the sale of these patent rights for $35 million, plus a share of future profits, and that BTG and Teleshuttle would no longer pursue those suits.  These patents and continuing license efforts are controlled by Intellectual Ventures.   Other patent portfolios in development relate to such areas as  --Big Data and The Internet of Things -- data exchange for smart, connected products, including usage data and ratings,  --Digital media storage and asset management, and  --The Idea Adoption Agency (including advanced methods for collaboration and reputation management). Consulting clients have included News Corporation/TVGuide, Dow Jones/Telerate, Euro RSCG/MVBMS, HealthScout/RxRemedy, AppliedTheory Communications, and BTG International, as well as Intellectual Ventures, RPX Corporation, and other prominent companies in the Intellectual Property space. (Teleshuttle is not seeking paid consulting work, but does selectively offer consulting on FairPay without fee.) Teleshuttle was founded by Richard Reisman in 1994 as an innovative online software/service provider. Reisman is an innovator and thought leader, advancing powerful interactive tools/media for human communication, collaboration, culture, and commerce since long before the Web. His media experience includes developing and marketing CoTV at Teleshuttle, a senior management role at HealthScout.com, leading the design and development of News Corp's original TVGuide Online service through market testing in the early '90s, managing development for Baseline (since acquired by The New York Times), and very early involvements in hypermedia, interactive graphics, and online communities.  Reisman has about 50 patents and many more allowed or pending.

Thoughtstar,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thoughtstar,1997-01-01,year,1-10,"Teams get things done. Technology gets things done. Successful businesses know it—and know how to make them work together. Thanks to the Internet explosion, it's easier than ever for customers, vendors, and employees to contribute to a project, even if they're far apart. At the same time, technology has made it harder to work together—it just doesn't feel like a team. There are more phone calls, more meetings, more documents delivered—and more holes that appear in critical processes. Some software vendors have attempted to tackle these challenges through groupware products. And while these applications solve communication problems on a company-wide level, they lack the day-to-day management and productivity tools people are desperate for. They just don't work for teams. Enter Thoughtstar. They envisioned a team-focused collaboration tool that could work over the Web. In 1997 they formed their vision into a company called Thoughtstar located in Sandy, Utah. The result of their vision is QuickTeam—an interactive workspace they call a Team Portal where people can go to communicate, collaborate, and add progress to a project. In short, it's a team's on-line headquarters. A whole new way for teams to work—and work more effectively. Today, QuickTeam is the first true—and complete—teamware solution available. You can host it on a corporate intranet, extranet, the Internet or a team member's computer—you can even lease the program from Thoughtstar or your ISP who will host it for you. QuickTeam is all Java, so it works on any platform. And users with no IT experience can install it once and run it over as many computers as necessary, no sweat. Plus, QuickTeam synchs up with the top groupware products a company may already have, making them more effective. And, it's got all the productivity tools your team needs to be more efficient—and more effective.",,"Collaboration, Computer, Information Technology, Software","Sandy, Utah, United States",Thoughtstar provides computer programming services and digital team collaboration tools.,"1,045,778",,,,,,,,,,,,

GSX products began because we all had first hand systems administration experience and suffered from a lack of proactive monitoring tools. Enhancing and expanding the tools we built to solve that problem, we created solutions with your IT communications administration in mind: As administrators, we had to wait for a maintenance window on servers to simply install some code. This is not the case with GSX Monitor which has no resident code. The entire solution can be rolled out in one hour and will not consume important server processing capacity which has to be reserved for end-user applications. We understand that you are not working on one single platform but a multitude of them. This is why we have ensured that all of your servers could be monitored from one single interface: Notes, Exchange, Sharepoint, BlackBerry Enterprise Server, Sametime, Quickr, Traveler, URLs. Once your team has control over one environment, extending it to another one is simple and natural. We provide complementary tools designed for both the administrators who need to identify issues and take remedial actions (GSX Server Guard), as well as the managers who need to get regular consistent reports to ensure that ovreall Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are being met (GSX Analyzer).

The Hub Culture group of companies is privately held with offices in Bermuda, Geneva, Hong Kong, London, San Francisco and New York. Dedicated representatives are in over 60 locations worldwide. The site has been noted in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Wired, PSFK, Harvard Business Review, CNNMoney, Forbes, WSJ, Finextra, Bloomberg and other financial media. In 2008, Hub Culture began developing Pavilions, member based workspaces in key cities offering coworking, concierge and consulting services, meeting space, and online collaboration tools on an internet based technology platform. Hub Culture Pavilions, both temporary and permanent, have appeared in London, Copenhagen, Cannes, Beijing, New York City, Los Angeles, Ibiza, Rio de Janeiro, Durban, Ho Chi Minh City, Cancun and other locations.  As of July 2013, Hub Culture lists over 25,000 members and has exchanged over 20 million units of Ven.

Ven first appeared as an application in Facebook on 4 July, 2007.

In 2010 Ven added Carbon to its basket components, alongside multiple currencies and commodities, making it the first green currency, with a theoretical carbon offset attached to each transaction.

Based on their feedback, scope and functionality were improved, resulting in a suite of tools covering the diverse needs of researchers in the field of molecular imaging. Due to the wide adaptation of PMOD in the field, support of the project within the University became difficult. Therefore, PMOD Technologies LLC was founded in 2003 as a spin-off of the Zurich PET Center to further develop and distribute the PMOD software. Since then, the customer base has massively grown, now comprising more than 550 sites with over 1000 active users worldwide. In parallel, functionality has been markedly extended, reaching into the neighboring domains of functional MRI and CT. Vibrant collaborations with various flagship institutions ensure that their PMOD software remains leading-edge. They aim to equip researchers with best-in-class software quantification tools for biomedical imaging in humans and animals, and to back them up in their experimental work by outstanding support and services.",http://www.pmod.com,"Collaboration, Information Technology, Software","Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland",PMOD Technologies has aim to equip researchers with best-in-class software quantification tools for biomedical imaging in humans & animals.,"503,828","3,948","4,482.17",-22.66%,"1,523.53%",0,1.01,-48.85%,99.09%,31.73%,"3,777,766","400,401",11.86%

The fully-integrated tools make it easy for a team of software developers to collaborate while working anywhere in the world. The management team can monitor the progress and communicate with the programmers using the Devizan management tools. The software deployment and maintenance are designed to be fast and efficient. With its emphasis on transparency, Devizan includes management tools that aren't available in traditional IDEs. The management team can look at the development project at any point in time, and view the changes that were made during the development and maintenance phases. Without relying upon old-fashioned screenshots or keyboard logs, Devizan delivers management-level information about all the changes that have been made to the system under development. Managers can stay as close to the development effort as they choose. Devizan can alert the management team every time a change is made. The task lists, built-in chat system, and status updates keep managers in the loop. The management team can preview all changes before deployment, examine the revision control documents, and call for a rollback of the code if they are not satisfied with the quality of the program release. Devizan features a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) that makes software development collaborative. The IDE supports syntax highlighting, multi-cursor collaborative editing, and built-in FTP for fast and easy uploads. The IDE is browser-based, and includes linear revision controls and edit history. Unlike traditional version-control systems that require checking programs in and out, Devizan lets all developers work in the current copy of the source code. The integration regimen makes it easy to see where one programmer left off and another programmer began. The software's preview function makes it simple to test changes to the code, and back the revised code out if a problem is detected. Devizan uses Amazon AWS servers housed in highly secure data centers. The environment can be customized to fit each Devizan user's needs. Resources are fully scalable, so Devizan users pay for only the resources that they use. The starter rate for a managed development environment with support of up to 10 users costs $15(US) per month. The 100-user plan costs $200 per month. Subscription costs include software updates, technical support, shared hosting costs, bandwidth, and system administration.",http://www.devizan.com,"Collaboration, Software","Pasadena, California, United States","Devizan delivers transparent cloud software solutions that aid in development, management, and deployment of websites.","1,488,837",,,,,,,,,,,,
