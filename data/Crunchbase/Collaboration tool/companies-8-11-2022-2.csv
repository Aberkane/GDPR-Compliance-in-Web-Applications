Evocalize has built the first Collaborative Marketing Platform to enable partners to execute complex marketing programs together that can't be run independently.  Evocalize is partnered deeply with Facebook and Google. ---------- Digital marketing continues to grow increasingly complex, which has paid large dividends in increased performance for large direct to consumer businesses. And, with digital advertising’s emerging privacy-first and cookie-less future taking center stage, the complexity of digital marketing will only increase.  Today, successful digital marketing programs are built upon three pillars: expertise, data, and technology. Large direct to consumer businesses often have all three key pillars, and reap the rewards. However, if a business is missing one or more of these pillars, they must enable collaborative marketing partnerships within, or outside of, their network to succeed.  Furthermore, if an organization has at least two of these pillars, typically data and expertise, they are well-positioned to create new revenue opportunities by enabling businesses in need with simple tools that grant access to performance marketing success in line with the largest direct to consumer (DTC) businesses. Collaborative marketing is an effective marketing strategy between a sponsoring partner (for example, a national marketing team, CRM providers, or marketplace) and a participating partner (for example, a local office, CRM user, non-DTC brand, or marketplace seller) that allows the execution of digital advertising programs using shared audience data, creative assets, messaging, and co-op budgets to achieve shared marketing goals.

But most businesses still don't work like that and fail to utilize the enormous potential of crowdsourced labor. Why? A major hurdle is that 'social collaboration' requires a totally different reward system. Mobbr is a unique payment system that helps businesses to make the transition to that new, much more effective way of working and organizing. With Mobbr it takes only one click to pay out 'social salary'. Real money, but distributed based on 'social' participation in business processes. To the crowd: groups of people that contribute to a task or collaboration. Anywhere on the internet. Mobbr will radically change the way that people work and earn money. Collaboration platforms are the offices and factories of the future. And in that future a significant part of the salaries worldwide will be 'social' and run through their platform.

Greenocracy,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greenocracy,2011-02-01,day,1-10,"Greenocracy is a political social networking site that facilitates user driven collaborative solutions to real life political problems. Users create online political profiles in order to participate in a variety of Greenocracy led political challenges. Within each challenge, users have the opportunity to earn participatory points, badges, exchangeable credits and even real money by completing a defined set of actions on the site. Each challenge is based upon set group of political issues and identified problems that vary in scope and size. Greenocracy helps to organize these issues into a set group of collaborative wiki pages that enable users to contribute, edit and fact check each others submissions. Each issue, or group of issues, also has an area reserved for further discourse and opinion based dialogue. Based upon these collected facts and user generated opinions, Greenocracy creates a series of challenges that focus on accomplishing a series of broadly and collaboratively defined political goals. For instance, based upon user generated content around the federal budget, Greenocracy might initiate a challenge that calls for users to submit their own solutions as to how they would solve a budgetary shortfall. Beyond this, Greenocracy awards points, badges and credits for those solutions that gain the most on site political traction, mainly by rewarding the solution author/author teams, or those who helped in shaping and amending the most successful solutions. Solutions themselves are vetted through a user based voting process in which each user can cast one vote per solution. Users are then awarded points, credits and badges based upon the number and type of votes they cast. Thus users are given a number of dynamic and unique means of engaging with the site while simultaneously working towards solving real political problems through an open and equitable process.",http://Greenocracy.org,"Blogging Platforms, Collaboration, Gamification, Internet, Politics, Social Media","Santa Cruz, California, United States",Greenocracy operates a political social networking forum that engages users to solve real time political problems.,"1,536,952",,,,,,,,,,,,

We look at ideas and say – Let’s actually do this.™  It all started in 2010, when we were doing strategy consulting for hospitals. Back then we were primarily consultants, with a limited leave-behind software to help track and monitor the plan we had built together.

What our clients really needed was a way to manage across these integrated plans at the same time, and to be able to see all supporting goals and activities from all their plans, in one view.  So, we supercharged our software and services to help them get everything in view, get everyone engaged, and get every possible advantage.

To ensure privacy and access at the lowest possible cost, CloudTop offers users a comprehensive suite of data storing, sharing and communication cloud apps that use enterprise-class security to access inexpensive public “pay-as-you-go” cloud storage or private “cloud-in-a-box” storage. With a CloudTop users can login to their public cloud storage  accounts (Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Storage, HP Storage, Rackspace Cloud Files, AT&T Synaptics, Nirvanix Storage) and/or private cloud-in-a-box (EMC Atmos, OpenStack Swift, MeghaWare Appliance) to auto slice into secure cloud workspaces and communication channels - for digital lockers, data backups, collaboration and several other use cases. Small business and professional users will find at least one secure cloud app to store or backup their data, or find one to synchronize files, contacts, calendars or notes across their PCs, Tablets or Smart Phones - as well as directly click to view or edit them with the appropriate device-installed apps.  Or choose a cloud app for creating a private work, play or social network and with a free invitee app link invite others to share files, post or pin content; email, instant message, collaborate or socialize in absolute privacy – as well as stay connected with them via public social networks, email, IM, etc. All CloudTop transactions are secured with vendor independent AES-256 encryption, including data stored on any MeghaWare cloud appliances used for local storage or caching - not using third party encryption or servers ensures data privacy from loss or theft and availability during service outages. With support for pay-as-you-go accounts and one-click migration or deletion, CloudTop users can shop around for free storage offers and the lowest monthly subscription fees from 7 industry leading providers – rent at will for pennies per month ($0 if unused) and save by paying per GB (used).  With support for cloud-in-a-box caching and storing, monthly subscription fees can be driven down to the bone or completely eliminated. Also, savings dramatically go up with the number of free invitee apps used, when compared to fees charged for every user by other cloud or traditional app vendors. Industry veterans Shawn Nagar and Leo Salazar came up with the idea of MeghaWare - personal cloud computing software - in early 2009, drawing on their experience in designing high performance computers (at DEC), creating a storage-networking company (acquired by EMC) and a storage-virtualization company (acquired by VMware).

P2P-Next,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/p2p-next,2008-02-01,day,11-50,"P2P-Next, created by the founders of Tribler,  is a pan-European conglomerate of 21 industrial partners, media content providers and research institutions. They are building a [""next-generation"" P2P client](http://torrentfreak.com/eu-invests-22-million-in-next-generation-bittorrent-client/) and announced a €15 million grant from the European Union in February 2008. Another €4 million is donated by 21 project partners, including the BBC. P2P-Next will develop an open source, efficient, trusted, personalized, user-centric and participatory television and media delivery mechanism with social and collaborative connotations using the emerging P2P paradigm, which takes into account the existing EU legal framework. From the company: _""The P2P-Next project will run over four years, and plans to conduct a large-scale technical trial of new media applications running on a wide range of consumer devices. If successful, this ambitious project could create a platform that would enable audiences to stream and interact with live content via a PC or set top box. In addition, it is our intention to allow audiences to build communities around their favourite content via a fully personalized system.  This technology could potentially be built into VOD services in the future and plans are underway to test the system for broadcasting the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest live online. We will have an open approach towards sharing results. All core software technology will be available as open source, enabling new business models. P2P-Next will also address a number of outstanding challenges related to content delivery over the internet, including technical, legal, regulatory, security, business and commercial issues.""_ The P2P-Next integrated project will build a next generation Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content delivery platform, to be designed, developed, and applied jointly by a consortium consisting of high-profile academic and industrial players with proven track records in innovation and commercial success. The current infrastructure of the Internet is not suited to simultaneous transmission of live events to millions of people (i.e. broadcasting). The problem is that a dedicated stream of data must be sent to every single user. With millions of potential users, the simultaneous streams of data will easily congest the Internet. For several years, we have been told that the answer to this problem is ""multicasting"", whereby the data stream is distributed to many local servers that subsequently ""re-broadcast"" the content to local users. However, most IP routers of the Internet cannot support multicasting—and there seems to be no financial incentive for the ISPs to introduce multicasting. Also, the use of Audiovisual Media is moving from a collective and passive approach to personal active behavior, at home and in mobile situations outside the home. At the same time use patterns are shifting towards non-linear usages, moving away from the classic model of linear broadcast TV. The TV set no longer has the monopoly of delivery of audiovisual content; the PC and related media centers, mobile phones, and potentially initiatives from new stakeholders are all becoming increasingly important. In such heterogeneous environments, efficient content delivery needs optimized unicast, multicast, broadcast, and also support for new mechanisms that have been made possible by the recent advances in P2P grids. This situation has important consequences for the existing business models and institutions, as well as for content production, content distribution, and end user experience on various terminals. This particular holds for stakeholders that propose services based on heterogeneous terminals and networks, together with the demand from users of transparent service continuity. This makes Peer-to-Peer -based technologies that can provide efficient and low-cost delivery of professional and user created content essential for the technologically-competitive future Europe. In response to these challenges, the objective of P2P-Next is to move forward the technical enablers to facilitate new business scenarios for the complete value chain in the content domain from a linear unidirectional push mode to a user centric, time and place independent platform paradigm. A platform approach allows modular development and modular applications, enables knowledge sharing and facilitates technology integration, code- and skill re-use. This translates to fast development of new content delivery applications that build value for service and content providers. P2P-Next will develop a platform that takes open source development, open standards, and future proof iterative integration as key design principles. These requirements will be developed through collaboration with European and national initiatives, as well as some of the largest and most sophisticated actors in the media and telecommunications sector, ensuring industrial relevance and worldwide application reach. P2P-Next involves 21 partners in 12 different countries, including large European players to ensure the future project's sustainability, SMEs and Subject Matter Experts to manage highly-focused technology components. P2P-Next will advance the state-of-the-art in important areas, including evolutionary content distribution, easy access to vast amount of content with metadata federation, social networking, and innovative business models for advertising. The sum of these advances is a large step towards moving the information access from the hands of a producer to the hands of the consumer, and allowing consumers to enjoy and utilise content resources in a mobile and pervasive manner, across the great online space.",http://www.p2p-next.org,"Collaboration, Open Source, Software","Tampere, Western Finland, Finland","P2P Next provides open source, participatory media delivery mechanisms with social and collaborative connotations using the P2P paradigm.","638,312",,,,,,,,,,,,
