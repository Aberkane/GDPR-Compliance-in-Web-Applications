I will give you a few examples.  Imagine a charity event in our city which needs the support of the locals. These locals  may want to contribute own time for the preparation and running of the event.  Imagine a storm or a flood which destroys the house of our neighbours. In an awful situation like this, they will desperately need help. Initially they will need shelter, food and clothing and then attention will turn to rebuilding their houses - all of this combined will help. Or imagine the ecosystem of the nearest mountain where hundreds of trees have been cut. The ecosystem which needs its own trees back to maintain the balance of the species living there. How about getting together people who have spades, trucks and all the necessary equipment to transport a few trees to the mountain and plant them? Well, it won’t be much but it’s a good start in helping nature sustain the effects of the human intervention and to keep the Earth a good and a sustainable place for our children. So, the purpose of Peoplegogo is to connect people through the Internet and in bringing them together, to give them the tools to cooperate. There might be many different approaches but personally I recognise two important tools - ideas and activities. The ideas are simply ideas we have in mind published and visible by anyone who visits Peoplegogo. That’s the place where you announce to the world what you want to do. Anyone who is interested in your idea can follow it and open a discussion. The reason you publish your idea is that if you keep it to yourself, no one will know about it and most probably you will never see it actually become something bigger. Publish your idea, say to the world what you want to do and you may be surprised that there are people around you who want the same thing. And the next important thing is the activities. They are real projects which we are confident are not just ideas but that are built on solid foundations and people will support them by contributing their skills, money and time. So, just stop for a minute and think about it. What are the things around you which can be done with the support of people that will improve your life and bring a positive impact on society?

Reach better decisions with your team and customers. New Product Introduction (NPI) is the most critical stage of manufacturing and it’s broken. An overwhelming majority of companies miss critical ship dates and suffer cost overruns due to NPI issues. Our experience designing and manufacturing thousands of physical products led us to deeply understand the costly mistakes, inefficiencies and frustration caused by sparse, error-prone analog 2D information and poor communication during NPI. These perpetual problems are only getting worse with shorter product windows, more geometrically complex products, higher quality expectations, engineering capacity constraints and fragile supply chains. Riven accelerates product introduction by vastly simplifying how teams develop, iterate and build physical products. Riven fixes broken workflows and enables everyone across the supply chain to work together – visually – on the same product by applying ‘rich as-made’ 3D part insights and digital models. By combining accurate digital 3D copies of real physical 3D parts with intelligent, collaborative software, we are creating a digital-first NPI workflow that improves customer responsiveness, time-to-market, part accuracy and production processes while minimizing development iterations and waste.

Schools and universities have problems to support students and teachers with all the different collaboration projects they expect them to do. Students need to co-create content for group assignments. Teachers need to collaborate on new courses and on other projects, but they have hardly any time together to do so. And teachers are searching for better on-line ways to support students with their assignments. They are looking for solutions that connect better with the natural on-line habitat of students.  Most available co-creation tools, like wiki's and Google Docs, are too complicated and they don't connect well with the on-line channels students and teachers like to use on a regular basis. They need to go to special websites they normally don't visit and they need to use specially created logins they keep mixing up. Email is no good solution either. It is too frustrating. Attached files get lost and versions of documents get mixed up all the time. And especially teachers are already suffering from an overload of email.  Bindrs are on-line co-working spaces that look like shared multi-media notebooks. Each contributor can connect them to his own preferred set of social media or to an e-mail address. * They keep co-creation and collaboration simple * They alert you on your favourite social networks when necessary, like no one else does * They keep it private like in a safe in Switzerland * They let you do so in style like Moleskine No installation of software or apps is needed, since we make use of the social media apps you already use. And no new logins need to be created. You can use your social media logins. Bindrs is a webapp that integrates/connects with your social media and works on all your devices. It's even possible to work together across different social media. We call this 'cross-social collaboration'. Bindrs is optimized for 'hit-and-run collaboration' to make all your time spent on a collaboration project as productive as possible. In short you could say we turned the good old school notebooks and exercise books into multi-media binders that connect to the social networks that are popular among students.

This approach improves the team’s existing, individual-centric forecasting techniques by incorporating collective intelligence. On the Myriada platform, a fund’s employees and members of their network are transformed into prediction engines - and these human predictions can also be combined with the output of computational models. By rapidly collating all estimations via weighted aggregation, Myriada generates rich, visually intelligible collective forecasts. For each, the group signal is statistically guaranteed to be more accurate than the average individual prediction, and is usually better than any individual. The power of correctly harnessed collective intelligence was empirically demonstrated with a 90-day macro multi-security trading strategy which yielded a Sharpe score of 3.66.
