e-Fásli,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/e-fásli,"THE PROBLEM To cool or heat the patient's body part, actually the only solution is the mirelite pea or the salt from the microwave. These solutions initially exert an excessive heat effect and damage the tissues, and after a few minutes are ineffective. If we ask the physician how exactly and how long the treatment will continue, he will not know because it is - in the absence of an appropriate tool - not a wellpublished scientific area. THE SOLUTION Our solution can maintain the set temperature in the range of 25 to 45 degrees Celsius, for hours. The type of disease, its location and the characteristics of the patient can all influence the proper therapy. These features are partially recorded by the patient to the smartphone application, or measured by the device. Collecting the scores of the symptoms from the patient (subjective score) or from the doctor (objective score) the analysis can evaluate the optimal treatment. WORK WE HAVE DONE SO FAR We have constructed the device to be enough strong for a continous work. It is wearable (WiFi connection, batteries) and there are multiple peripheral unitsts for different body parts. The central part is common, it is connected to the peripheral part by a cable and a plug. The GUI is highly customizable, depending on the gender, the age and the nationality of the user. The next step is to check the specifications for used materials and operating parameters. WHAT MAKES OUR SOLUTION INNOVATIVE Currently, the device has no alternative. Based on the patent, this can be the first therapeutic tool to develop itself by collecting and analyzing data. The control panel is a smartphone app, so it can be always up-to-date and it can advertise personalized supply (e.g. clinics, pharmaceuticals, shops) even in an anonimous environment. There are no sensitive data (like email, phone Nr or name) stored about the patients. The device GUI is password protected. DESCRIPTION OF USP The innovation has been presented In the Shanghai TV's ""Junior Edison"" competition. This, according to the creators of the show, means 12 million views. This is a great opportunity to introduce the product and to find a manufacturing partner in China (we do not exclude this option). In the first period we plan to sell the basic equipment as a wellness device. Then we can develop a centrallycontrolled, strilizable device for hospital use. THE IP SITUATION The patent (P1700449) is actually approved as a national (Hungarian) patent but it protects the invention for the first year. On this summer we plan to extend the protection to the international level. The only author of this patent is Melinda Szegedi but it was submitted to this startup company as contribution. HOW WE WILL EARN MONEY There is a wide demand for the device. Calculating the appropriate patient groups, the frequency of thermo-therapy and the financial resources of each country, we can state that we have millions of potential buyers. The results of innovation competitions in Hungary, China (and hopefully in America, thanks to the ongoing Intel ISEF competition), provide a great media coverage. Over 10 million people who hear about the invention without any paid marketing activity. IDENTIFIED COMPETITORS We have mapped similar patents and competitors during the patent literature research. The products closest to the present invention are: Wristify, Heated Jacket, Refrigerated Helmets, and pre-hair refinishing caps for chemotherapy. We want to prove our theory about the physiological mechanism of thermo-therapy (called ""immunocyte thermotaxis"") which explains the effectiveness of low energy contact heat conduction therapy.","Cloud Storage, Health Care, Internet of Things, Medical Device, Personal Health",http://e-fasli.hu,"Szeged, Szeged, Hungary",smart medical device development,"150,323",,,,,,,,,,,,,European Union (EU),Active,2018-04-24,day,4,1-10,"Dóra Szegedi, Melinda Szegedi, Viktor Sebestyén Varga, Zsolt Szegedi",,,,,
