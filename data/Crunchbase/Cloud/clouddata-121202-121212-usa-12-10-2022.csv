PDFFiller,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pdffiller,"PDFfiller is a document management platform that allows users to edit, sign, store, and share documents via any web browser or mobile device. History The PDFfiller platform was originally created in 2007 by Vadim Yasinovsky as a personal tool for a friend who needed to digitally fill a form and wasn’t happy with the services available at the time, particularly the requirement to download and install expensive, specialized software. Over the next few years, the application was given to friends, family, and acquaintances by request, and quickly grew in popularity. As the user base of PDFfiller grew, so did feature requests from its users, and it became apparent that the initial problem Yasinovsky set out to solve affected more than just friends and family. The platform quickly grew from being a simple solution for a few people into a full-fledged company, and PDFfiller was officially incorporated in 2009. As of 2014, PDFfiller has employees in 7 countries around the world, working in product development, engineering, marketing, operations, and 24/7/365 technical support. How It Works  PDFfiller allows users to add documents in PDF, Microsoft Word, Microsoft Powerpoint, or Notepad formats by uploading from a local disk, importing from Dropbox or Google Drive, by emailing their unique PDFfiller email address, or by using the platform’s document search engine containing over 10 million fillable forms.  PDFfiller’s editing tools include: add text, highlight, erase, redact, check or circle items, add shapes, add images, add notes, draw freehand, and add signature. Signatures are powered by the company’s DigiSign technology, and can be added by typing, uploading, photographing with a webcam,  or signing with a mouse, trackpad, or on a mobile device screen. The platform’s document management features also allows users to reorganize, merge or delete document pages. Once completed, documents can be saved locally to a computer, emailed (standard or secure), printed, or eFaxed. The service also offers a share feature with which up to 5 users can collaborate on a document, and a SendToSign feature that allows users to request up digital signatures, which are verified by the company. In 2014, PDFfiller introduced Inbound Fax, an add on service that allows users to claim their own fax number and receive faxed documents directly into their account.  Since its founding, PDFfiller’s user base has expanded 100 fold, 20 fold in the last two years, and averages 2 million users annually with 20,000 forms filled per day. The service’s capabilities have grown from simply allowing users to add text and signatures to offering two dozen editing and sharing features, including the ability to highlight and redact text, add images, and collaborate with multiple users. Despite its growth, the PDFfiller is still focused on solving singular document editing problems for individuals, and strives to save users time and money through powerfully simple features that offer freedom from software and access to documents anywhere, anytime, from any device.","Apps, Cloud Data Services, Developer Tools, Document Management, SaaS, Software",http://www.pdffiller.com,"Brookline Village, Massachusetts, United States","Edit, sign, store, and share documents via any web browser or mobile device with PDFfiller","126,727","15,399,347","17,151,109.67",-15.41%,12.91%,516,3.29,11.48%,45.49%,-7.93%,"11,313","2,642",30.47%,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",Active,2007-01-01,year,3,51-100,"Boris Shakhnovich, Semyon Dukach, Vadim Yasinovsky",3,,,,

Atomicorp includes GotRoot labs, which was formed in 1998 by the founders of Atomicorp and has since been merged with Atomicorp and is no longer a separate entity (same personnel, assets, and location). The founders of Atomicorp are industry recognized experts in the field of cyber security and prior to forming Atomicorp, were co-founders of Plesk and members of the Wheelgroup team that developed first commercial network intrusion detections system which was subsequently acquired by Cisco and made the basis for their IDS security offerings (see Management Team descriptions below). The Atomicorp team has pioneered a number of new approaches to security. They are the inventors of “Just in Time” or “Virtual” patching (JTIP). JITP is a method of developing virtual patches for applications before a vendor has released a security fix. JITP allows an end-user of the vulnerable application to continue to use it in a secure manner without needing to wait for the vendor to release an official patch. In many cases where JITP is properly deployed, the user may never need to patch the application. Atomicorp also pioneered methods such as layer 7 protocol scrubbing and the use of regular expression engines to simplify the creation of new signatures for Intrusion Detection systems. Another innovation of Atomicorp is distributed vulnerability assessments through light weight automatically deployed “dumb agents”, and later through direct remote-command control of systems.","Cloud Data Services, Cyber Security, Security",http://www.atomicorp.com/,"Chantilly, Virginia, United States",Atomicorp is the developer of industry leading solutions for the protection and support of cloud.,"99,725","11,988","11,996.17",-22.54%,-95.27%,27,1.62,-66.35%,63.46%,9.58%,"2,035,121","324,905",19%,"Washington DC Metro Area, East Coast, Southern US",Active,2006-01-01,year,2,11-50,"Michael Shinn, Scott Shinn",,,80245,USD,80245

The company was founded in 2004 and is currently headquartered in Enola, Pennsylvania. Originally founded in 2004 in Central Pennsylvania primarily as a wireless networking and tower construction company, as time evolved there were more and more requirements to get deeper into the IT space beyond simply connecting wireless access points and microwave radios. This evolution of technology led to a series of acquisitions for Netrepid, and the company found itself evolving into more of an IT Services provider. In 2009, Netrepid acquired Pennsylvania Online, an Internet service provider originally founded in 1993. This acquisition provided the start of an established data center, call center, and support teams for Netrepid. In 2011, Netrepid acquired GameChanger Technology and the following year, Netrepid also acquired Lion Technologies. Both acquisitions allowed Netrepid the opportunity to increase its capabilities in the area of managed IT services for residents and small businesses in the Central PA-area.  Today, Netrepid provides enterprise class infrastructure hosting services for a large variety of industries including the professional services industry, manufacturers, transportation and logistics providers, and companies involved in all areas of the supply chain.

NephOS is a one-stop-shop single software solution for building public, private, and hybrid clouds. Benefits of using OpenStack are that it can be highly customized to meet specific customer hardware and software integration and automation requirements, and being open source software that can run on commodity hardware it delivers significant cost reductions. Many service providers and enterprises are looking for turn-key multi-tenant OpenStack based cloud software solutions because typical single tenant clouds do not meet their ever more demanding requirements.

NephOS is the only software stack that delivers this as a turnkey solution, out-of-the-box.
