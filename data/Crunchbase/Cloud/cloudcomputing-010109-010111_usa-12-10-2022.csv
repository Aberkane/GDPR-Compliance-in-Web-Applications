Infinetics Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/infinetics,"Infinetics has designed and implemented Long Hop™, a high performance network connection architecture that provides significantly better tradeoffs between bandwidth, latency, fault tolerance and cost than previously known approaches. Long Hop networks are more cost efficient than a fat-tree, supporting at least 50% more servers using the same network hardware while providing equivalent bandwidth and improved latency of at least 25%. Oversubscription and fault tolerance can also be smoothly varied to meet cost and performance goals. Long Hop’s regular wiring patterns maximize the number of short connections and minimize the number of long distance connections between server rows or containers, thereby reducing cabling costs and simplifying expansion by reducing or eliminating rewiring. Long Hop networks well serve the needs of modern data centers by providing consistent bandwidth under varying load conditions via extensive multi-path support and automatic load balancing, allowing mobile workloads to be placed without regard to available bandwidth, and allowing services to be isolated in a multi-tenant environment to match the business needs of customers.  Long Hop achieves this by combining patent-pending wiring methods with a simple high-performance, TCAM-efficient forwarding method well suited to the current generation of network switch hardware and SDN controllers supporting OpenFlow or proprietary southbound APIs. The wiring method starts with a highly symmetrical framework well suited to economical, fault tolerant switching, and overlays another symmetrical network of short cuts that simultaneously amplify available bandwidth as well as reduce latency. The end result gives the ability to design and construct networks that precisely meet implementation-specific business needs.","Cloud Computing, Developer Platform, Enterprise Software",http://www.infinetics.com,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States","Infinetics develops network architecture and software products such as the Long Hop, a high performance network connection architecture.","239,567",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",Active,2009-01-01,year,1,11-50,Anthony Antonuccio,,,,,

CloudOptix,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudoptix,"CloudOptix (CO) has developed a personal cloud computing software product called CloudTop, that can be downloaded from their website onto personal computers, notebooks, tablets and smart phones. To ensure privacy and access at the lowest possible cost, CloudTop offers users a comprehensive suite of data storing, sharing and communication cloud apps that use enterprise-class security to access inexpensive public “pay-as-you-go” cloud storage or private “cloud-in-a-box” storage. With a CloudTop users can login to their public cloud storage  accounts (Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Storage, HP Storage, Rackspace Cloud Files, AT&T Synaptics, Nirvanix Storage) and/or private cloud-in-a-box (EMC Atmos, OpenStack Swift, MeghaWare Appliance) to auto slice into secure cloud workspaces and communication channels - for digital lockers, data backups, collaboration and several other use cases. Small business and professional users will find at least one secure cloud app to store or backup their data, or find one to synchronize files, contacts, calendars or notes across their PCs, Tablets or Smart Phones - as well as directly click to view or edit them with the appropriate device-installed apps.  Or choose a cloud app for creating a private work, play or social network and with a free invitee app link invite others to share files, post or pin content; email, instant message, collaborate or socialize in absolute privacy – as well as stay connected with them via public social networks, email, IM, etc. All CloudTop transactions are secured with vendor independent AES-256 encryption, including data stored on any MeghaWare cloud appliances used for local storage or caching - not using third party encryption or servers ensures data privacy from loss or theft and availability during service outages. With support for pay-as-you-go accounts and one-click migration or deletion, CloudTop users can shop around for free storage offers and the lowest monthly subscription fees from 7 industry leading providers – rent at will for pennies per month ($0 if unused) and save by paying per GB (used).  With support for cloud-in-a-box caching and storing, monthly subscription fees can be driven down to the bone or completely eliminated. Also, savings dramatically go up with the number of free invitee apps used, when compared to fees charged for every user by other cloud or traditional app vendors. Industry veterans Shawn Nagar and Leo Salazar came up with the idea of MeghaWare - personal cloud computing software - in early 2009, drawing on their experience in designing high performance computers (at DEC), creating a storage-networking company (acquired by EMC) and a storage-virtualization company (acquired by VMware). Ashish Nagar joined the founding team in January 2010, to head product engineering in India.   MeghaWare is a registered trademark and brand name for CO's cloud computing family of software products. CloudTop is a registered trademark and brand name of their flagship product.  CO is a privately held software company founded in May, 2009. Primarily focused on the front-end of cloud computing, it has developed virtual cloud computing software. Sold as the MeghaWare CloudTop, it offers users their own suite of cloud computing applications and a personal cloud created from virtually connecting their public and private cloud storage accounts. They are headquartered in Boca Raton, FL. They have R&D centers in Massachusetts, Texas and California. Their Product Engineering and Technical Support offices are located in India.","Cloud Computing, Cloud Management, Collaboration, Cyber Security, Logistics, Privacy, Software",http://www.meghaware.com,"Boca Raton, Florida, United States",CloudOptix is a Personal Cloud Computing.,"644,506",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater Miami Area, East Coast, Southern US",Closed,2009-05-01,day,,51-100,,,,,,

Tabz provides the ability to create corporate marketplaces where employee application administration can be consolidated or public-facing partnership portals can be promoted. The Tabz platform is the first step in creating an environment for corporate chain supply management: equipping companies to intuitively manage access rights and permissions to granular levels thus controlling varying degrees of transparency for sharing information with their unique audiences.  The product introduces companies to a variety of applications aimed at facilitating business development and operations while providing the flexibility to incorporate existing legacy systems or bespoke corporate portals into the environment.  The Tabz platform thereby facilitates the creation of custom integrations and migrations between disparate apps, cloud-based environments and on-premise hardware or software which ultimately leads to higher employee adoption of evolving technologies. DevDesk will be introducing modules to further promote the consolidation, visualization and tracking of data across multiple companies and technologies: a concept they have coined ""Multi-Business Management"" (MBM).  The primary goal of their MBM suite of tools is to manage multiple businesses, subsidiaries, trades, brands and independent operations from a single source.  Core modules such as CRM, Salesforce, Property, Project and Document Management are being introduced to address this goal and revolve around their founding principles of â€œconnecting people, places and projectsâ€.
