Integromat,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/integromat-2,"Integromat is an integration and automation service offering unique features. Here is a short overview: * Automations can be very complex. You can automate an unlimited number of consecutive actions, not just 1:1 (if this:then that). Each action has at its disposal data returned by previous actions. This allows you to automate your entire workflow, not just one part. * Integromat gives you the possibility to use built-in routers to duplicate any incoming data. Using routers, you can divide your scenario into multiple routes and process data separately in each route. More information can be found here: http://intm.at/b/4  * Integromat supports dynamically created inputs and outputs. Thanks to this feature you can, for example, call remote database procedures and map their input and output variables. It’s a function that you won't find anywhere else. * Built-in feeders are special modules that can split incoming data into multiple parts and then process each part separately. For example, if you receive an email with multiple attachments, you can handle each attachment separately. * Aggregators, on the other hand, allow to merge individual data into a single bundle. We can, for example, create a ZIP archive of files contained in a specific folder and then save it or send it anywhere. More information on feeders and aggregators can be found here: http://intm.at/b/3  * We can work with files as if they were binary data. Therefore we do not need to know the path to a folder. This lets you, for example, transform images or work with file content as with a text. * Another unique feature is the possibility to schedule webhooks. With Integromat you can, for example, make an automation that will gather text messages received on your mobile phone during a day and then at midnight select a winner. Standard webhooks are of course also supported. * We support serialization and deserialization of JSON documents and give you the possibility to work with your data in any way. Nested objects or fields are no problem for us. * Thanks to the transaction processing of data, Integromat is able to complete an entire automation as scheduled. In case of error, Integromat reverts all changes and restores the initial state. In short, it will either perform all actions as scheduled or nothing. * Integromat stores incomplete runs (DLQ). If an automation encounters an error, we will save its state. This ensures that no data are lost. You can then fix the issue and continue executing from where it was stopped. * Perfect visualization of everything you do. From possibility to watch how your automation is being executed to visualization of data flow in the Execution history. Currently, we support 110 services (https://www.integromat.com/en/integrations) and thanks to the integrated support for the most widely used databases (MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL) Integromat offers almost unlimited possibilities for automation. We continuously expand our list of supported services.","Cloud Computing, Cloud Data Services, Data Integration, SaaS, Software",https://www.integromat.com,"Prague, Hlavni mesto Praha, Czech Republic",Integromat is a software developer of workflow automation applications.,"95,015","6,064,770","2,367,551.5",547.85%,-48.03%,461,6.82,29.36%,29.13%,-24.47%,"26,580","-84,821",-76.14%,European Union (EU),Active,2012-01-01,year,6,11-50,"Michal Toman, Ondřej Gazda, Patrik Šimek, Pavel Duras, Roman Bršlica, Tomáš Schel",2,36,,,

Dreamdata,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dreamdata-io,"In B2B, the biggest challenge marketers face is connecting their activities with revenue. There are just too many touchpoints and people involved in the buying decision, resulting in complex buyer journeys and long sales cycles. Transparency gets lost.  Everyone knows that B2B revenue attribution is important, but where do you even start? The bigger the ad spend, the bigger the potential... but also the pain! To try and solve this, a lot of companies still rely on attribution systems that are stitched together in Excel from a mix of ill-maintained B2C tools (e.g. Google Analytics and Facebook attribution), giving them a skewed view of their revenue reality.  We’ve been there! In our previous jobs, we searched for a product that could replace our scrappy semi-solutions without draining internal resources: a solution that would continue to get developed and actually help us understand the full value of our actions. We couldn’t find one. So we decided to build one ourselves. Enter Dreamdata, the B2B revenue attribution platform for small to midsize B2B companies who have the ambition to be truly data-driven. Our customers typically close multiple deals a month and do inside sales with a significant digital ad spend and annual revenue ranging from a few million to hundreds of millions of dollars. We pull together and clean existing, siloed, commercial data sources before joining them with behavioral data to give a holistic reflection of the actual B2B customer journey and transform it into easy-to-digest, actionable analysis.  Dreamdata integrates with just about any commercial tool and traffic source, so your teams won’t be forced to use certain vendors or suites. You’re free to use best-in-class tools! What if you were asked to double next year's ad spend? What if a pandemic strikes and you’re suddenly forced to cut your marketing activities by 50%? What would you do? Do you actually trust your data enough to present a sound way forward? In situations like these, there’s nothing more dangerous than bad data. What might look like a good plan you want to act on can actually be a bad decision in disguise. Is your B2B’s data prepared and ready to go?  By taking care of all the data-crunching, Dreamdata allows demand generation and commercial ops professionals to focus on which B2B go-to-market (GTM) efforts are actually paying off and enables them to repeat the success and stop wasting money.  Our out-of-the-box platform helps you to answer vital B2B marketing questions like which campaigns and channels to stop or scale, what’s the return on ad spend, and how long it takes to acquire new customers. If you’re all about granularity it’s even possible to do attribution to (and between!) every pipeline stage as well. Applying attribution to pipeline stages allows Dreamdata customers to optimize every step of their customer journeys.  With the Dreamdata insights, B2B marketing and sales align like never before. B2Bs need to realize that revenue creation is most effective when it’s done as a team effort. Every touch of every deal is disclosed. No more guesswork. No more opinions. With this unrivaled transparency, it’s not unusual to see campaign effectiveness and marketing ROI improve by more than 50%.","Analytics, B2B, Cloud Data Services, Data Integration, Data Visualization, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics",https://dreamdata.io,"Copenhagen, Hovedstaden, Denmark",Dreamdata is a B2B revenue automation platform.

Garden,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/garden-io,"Garden is a Kubernetes testing platform for every step of the development process.  The widespread adoption of cloud native technologies such as containers and Kubernetes has made it easier than ever to operate and scale applications. But important developer workflows have been overlooked or neglected along the way. Many developers find that they’re now less productive than they were before the cloud native era. Testing is a critical part of the development process and one that’s in need of a major upgrade. Modern cloud native testing practices are largely driven by what’s feasible rather than what’s useful. Developers working on distributed microservices applications have been left without an efficient way to build, run tests, and troubleshoot in a production-like environment. Garden makes it easy to spin up ephemeral testing and preview environments for integration tests, manual QA, and development. With Garden, developers get fast feedback exactly when they need it, and DevOps teams are no longer bogged down with provisioning and managing ad hoc environments.

ThreeB IT,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/threeb-it-gmbh,"We are a startup from Ibbenbüren that has turned our passion for software development into a profession. We currently consist of Thimo Buchheister and Thorsten Brügge, who have been working together as software engineers for a long time and who decided in 2019 to make the world of digital processes accessible to everyone. As CEO, Thimo Buchheister is currently primarily involved in the development of our ThreeNamic platform. With his many years of experience as a software engineer and in-depth knowledge of mobile and cloud development, software engineering, databases, blockchain and IT project management, he has an overview of the big picture and always keeps the company and our products at the forefront of current technologies. As COO, Thorsten Bruges is our creative and communicative mind. He is responsible for the development of our products and is in constant contact with our customers and partners. With his experience in machine learning, he is also responsible for the automation of ThreeNamic's processes. Through his experience in industry and in sales, Thorsten has an important perspective on the necessary functionality of our products and advises our customers on all aspects of our products, projects and the company. There are a number of software solutions on the market that support entrepreneurs in capturing the data necessary for their everyday work and making adjustments. Most offers here have in common that the user has to submit to the procedures prescribed by the program or that the software only displays a snapshot. Our vision is software that can be adapted to the needs of the user and that also accompanies and documents the entire process. We would also like to create the possibility of accessing the processes from anywhere in order to enable modern and location-independent work. Today this is only possible if an entrepreneur can raise the necessary capital to have customized software programmed. With ThreeNamic, we want to give every entrepreneur - regardless of type and size - the opportunity to adapt a software solution to their needs. Our customers should concentrate on their core competencies and know that our software is the perfect digital partner by their side. In many conversations we have heard that digital developments in many companies are still in their infancy and that those responsible are facing major challenges. Most companies already have processes that have proven themselves over long periods of time. The introduction of new software is then not only the transfer of data into a new system, but in most cases also an adaptation of current processes to the processes specified by the new system. We want to be the solution here. Our goal is to enable every company to become more efficient with the help of digitization. We enable the smallest start-up to the largest company to digitize all corporate processes on a global scale and thus work more effectively, transparently and securely. Starting with training for customers and employees, the planning and organization of events or meetings, through the digitization of training and further education to the complete automation of critical company processes, with ThreeNamic we have the appropriate solution.","Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Cloud Data Services, Image Recognition, Industrial Automation, Information Technology, SaaS, Software",https://threebit.io,"Ibbenbüren, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany",ThreeB IT is a german startup that runs a digital process management and automation SaaS platform for corporations of any industry and size.,"154,579","1,470","5,614.67",-90.48%,"1,300%",34,2,100%,0%,37.12%,"6,229,180","4,516,858",263.79%,European Union (EU),Active,2019-03-01,day,2,1-10,"Thimo Buchheister, Thorsten Brügge",,,,,

RiskSystem may also be used for regulatory reporting with the ability to provide the relevant risk figures for ESMA, Form PF and OPERA reports. Whilst all clients can determine the manner in which the functionality is delivered, special emphasis has been placed upon creating a solution for the risk requirements of the AIFMD, namely funds requiring “functionally and hierarchically separate” risk management. As part of this effort an AIFMD risk dashboard click to view has been created which allows risk managers, CIO’s, fund managers and even board directors to see exactly where any problems are occurring or where potential breaches of limits may occur.

Back in 2011, when the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) had not yet gained popularity and the driving concept was Machine to Machine (M2M), Jaume Rey, our CEO and Founder, decided to establish a company dedicated to the remote maintenance of a variety of device types via the internet. A few months later, M2M Cloud Factory, S.L. was set up and we started the development of what today is MIIMETIQ® technology: the Core of all our Products (MIIMETIQ® IoT COMPOSER, MIIMETIQ® LITE and MIIMETIQ® EDGE). From the beginning, Jaume Rey was clear that MIIMETIQ® Technology should be made available to, and used by, System Integrators. This led to the development of an architecture which, at its heart, had to be flexible, scalable and secure. The goal was that every System Integrator, using MIIMETIQ, would be able to deliver to its customers customized solutions, from small projects to large deployments, able to exchange data with any type of third party software and with High Grade Enterprise Security. As a rapidly expanding global business, our aim is to be one of the main players in the Industrial IoT (IIoT) with a strong focus on Industry 4.0, Smart Buildings, e-Health and Retail.

Ukkobox,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ukkobox,"Ukkobox helps SMEs deal with personal data in a secure and compliant manner.  Sensitive data loss and leaks are problems faced by more than 78% of SMBs according to a 2014 survey. Among them, 72% shut down less than 1 year after the incident. Just one of these incidents led to $6.2M losses. The solutions currently are either insufficient of too expensive for these companies. Ukkobox (Company no. 09527513 - UK). has an easy tool that safely encrypts and spreads user files to existing cloud providers worldwide. Because they store only parts of the files on each provider with redundancy, they are secured and accessible even if some of these providers suffer an outage or are hacked.  Their unique dispersal process developed by Univ. of São Paulo (Brazil) and Univ. of Leicester (UK) represents an entry technological barrier that can be patented. If the user requires additional privacy levels, they can choose providers from states with weak international relations among themselves and distinct data privacy laws/regulations. This provides an additional geopolitical security mechanism resilient to encryption vulnerabilities, which makes unauthorized access even from governments almost impossible. They will have to cooperate with ""enemies"" countries to retrieve all data slices and also break data encryption to access user files.This technology able to scale globally along with a multi-skilled team, composed with founders with high technical security and cloud background, business knowledge, international law and creative marketing and design are the most interesting Ukkobox assets.  For the user it is straightforward. He just download and install their  app, choose the providers and countries he wishes to use for his spreading storage box, receives a temporary authentication token in his mobile and put the files inside Ukkobox folder. Their app will then encrypt, split and spread the files from the user device to storage providers directly. This ensures that they will have zero knowledge of the user stored data and access patterns. Thus ensuring full privacy for their customer's stored data. They will monetize their  solution using a SaaS model. The consumer chooses the providers (and countries) used to create his private data storage network, the storage size he need and the amount of users. From these informations, the monthly/yearly price is calculated. This model offers the reliability to use several storage providers at the same time avoiding vendor lock-in, increasing availability, privacy and security but with the convenience to manage only one account.","Cloud Data Services, Cyber Security, Information Technology, Internet, SaaS, Security",http://www.ukkobox.com,"London, England, United Kingdom",Multi cloud protected storage layer service for high sensitive data.,"187,751",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Active,2015-04-07,day,3,1-10,"Edgard Regolão Jr, Paul Chu, Rafael Libardi",,,,,

Stadyum,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stadyum,"Most of sport clubs in the CEE region have limited information about shopping behavior of their customers – fans. That is ridiculous, keeping in mind the possibilities of information technologies we have nowadays. And even if the club has these information, these records are typically saved in separated tabular tools. This makes it difficult to be used and also increases rate of mistakes in data, so clubs cannot communicate with fans personally. We bring to clubs well-structured and self-filling database system about their customers and their purchases and other activities. The club is now able to meet its customers, track their loyalty and use these data to send targeted business messages which increase sales in reality. This effectivity is fully measurable, so it is able to count financial benefit of each customer, respectively of whole system Stadyum CRM to the club. Stadyum CRM is a web application connected to ticketing and merchandising systems of clubs via API. It receives personalized data which are analyzed and processed into statistics. We connect them with every home match of the club and add factors affecting attendance in the stadium. These combined data are used for targeted emails. In future, we plan to use it for SMS, smartphone notifications and messages via Messenger, Whatsapp or Viber in omnichannel model. We also collect feedback from attendees to provide better services in the stadium, because it is important to track the satisfaction of customers in any business. It helps to improve services of refreshment, security guards or cleanliness of the stadium (seats, toilets etc.). It is also a new channel how to get a direct contact of fans when you motivate them to fill the form e.g. by next match tickets lottery. In next section, we analyze variable aspects of tickets and season tickets like pre-sales or passing customers through turnstiles before a match. And of course, there is a comparison of match attendances and its revenues. In general, club managers will get complete, central overview on their customers (like regular fans, season ticket holders, partners and other stakeholders) and their purchases.","Advertising Platforms, Analytics, App Marketing, B2B, B2C, Big Data, Business Development, Business Information Systems, Business Intelligence, Cloud Data Services, Consulting, Consumer Research, CRM, Customer Service, Digital Marketing, Email, Email Marketing, eSports, Event Management, Event Promotion, Events, Food and Beverage, Food Delivery, Hockey, Information Technology, Leisure, Marketing, Marketing Automation, Messaging, Public Relations, SaaS, Sales, Sales Automation, SMS, Social Media, Software, Sports, Ticketing",http://stadyumcrm.com,"Prague, Hlavni mesto Praha, Czech Republic",Smart CRM system for sports club management and refreshment delivery to seat.,"645,842",,,,,,,,,,,,,European Union (EU),Active,2013-11-01,month,3,1-10,"Adam Borovský, Michal Kožuch, Petr Križek",,,,,
