From inception we have positioned ourselves as a provider of internet services - and remained true to this event at the height of the dotcom boom of the '90s, when everyone was making millions of developing portals and selling websites. At Calport we focus on developing our own in-house platforms for a wide range of solutions such as digital marketing, web analytics, monetization and web hosting, among others. This gives us an edge over those of our competitors who resell the services of others or limit the benefit that they are able to provide to their clients to whatever IT is ready-made and available off-the-shelf. Our clients benefit by using our robust and functional solutions which we freely customize to meet the requirements and upon which our client's business processes run without the compromise of being force-fit into a 'one size fits all' solution.","Cloud Management, Digital Marketing, Information Technology, Internet, Marketing Automation, Mobile Apps, Software, Web Design, Web Hosting",https://www.calport.com,"Kolkata, West Bengal, India",Professional Internet Services,"1,196,030",,,,,,,,,,,,,Asia-Pacific (APAC),Active,1995-01-16,day,,1-10,,,,,,
