Garden,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/garden-io,"Garden is a Kubernetes testing platform for every step of the development process.  The widespread adoption of cloud native technologies such as containers and Kubernetes has made it easier than ever to operate and scale applications. But important developer workflows have been overlooked or neglected along the way. Many developers find that they’re now less productive than they were before the cloud native era. Testing is a critical part of the development process and one that’s in need of a major upgrade. Modern cloud native testing practices are largely driven by what’s feasible rather than what’s useful. Developers working on distributed microservices applications have been left without an efficient way to build, run tests, and troubleshoot in a production-like environment. Garden makes it easy to spin up ephemeral testing and preview environments for integration tests, manual QA, and development. With Garden, developers get fast feedback exactly when they need it, and DevOps teams are no longer bogged down with provisioning and managing ad hoc environments.

Wyconn,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wyconn,"Wyconn’s products for OEMs, enterprises, and telecom companies combine the functions of a router, access point, firewall, and gateway and include embedded global SIMs, all managed through a web-based management console.  The design of this hardware-software solution lowers the cost and time required for large-scale deployments to connect people, sensors, machines, and organizations. The radically simpler approach to the design of Wyconn’s products combines the simplicity of installing modern consumer products with the web-based tools large enterprises, telecoms, and service providers need to manage devices that number in the hundreds of thousands.   In addition, Wyconn devices run applications that can be deployed, managed, and updated centrally.  Standard applications available now include Wyconn Router Companion, pairing a Wyconn device with a remote router or switch for out-of-band management, and Wyconn Branch Connector for enterprises, retail chains, and distributed services companies. Background The company’s products were first introduced at the 2014 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona:  ""As connectivity service provider we use remote device management for millions of customers' internet access devices on a daily basis. With Wyconn we can offer this functionality to our enterprise customers. From SMEs to large corporations, their IT managers, administrators and system integrators can now easily access and manage their network devices, even when there is no WAN connection available."" said Richard Palmetzhofer, Managing Director for sales at Telekom Austria Group M2M. ""We are impressed by Wyconn's approach to reduce installation complexity and costs through the built in SIMs and the cloud-based management platform, and are looking forward to partnering with them during the roll-out across Europe.""  Wyconn is a member of the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC):  “The Industrial Internet Consortium was founded as an international organization and we’re excited that Wyconn has signed on as one of our first European members,” said Dr. Richard Soley, Executive Director of the IIC. “Wyconn understands the practical challenges with large-scale deployments and we look forward to leveraging their expertise as we continue to accelerate the growth of the Industrial Internet.” Wyconn will participate in the IIC quarterly meeting in Boston June 18 – 19, 2014.  This fall the company will participate in CTIA’s Super Mobility Week (September 9 – 11, 2014) in Las Vegas and will present at M2M Innovation World Congress in Marseille (September 22 – 24, 2014).","Cloud Management, Enterprise Software, Hardware, Software",http://www.Wyconn.com,"Vienna, Wien, Austria","A radically simpler solution for M2M/IoT and connectivity for OEMs, enterprises and telcos with easy-to-install devices and cloud-based mgt.","957,091",,,,,,,,,,,,,European Union (EU),Closed,2013-01-01,year,1,11-50,Adi Reschenhofer,,,,,
