With 550+ customers, 100k+ monthly users and 10M+ assets managed, MediaSilo continues to innovate and provide solutions that span media, entertainment and enterprise video, with a focus on security.  Most recently, MediaSilo launched SafeStream, an on-demand watermarking technology that acts as a visual deterrant to piracy. Each watermarked video is created in real-time and is personalized to the person requesting or viewing the asset.  Because the customized watermark is inserted in near real-time (less than a 20-second delay) – even for a 90-minute video – the speed and cost-effectiveness of SafeStream is unheard of the industry, and is not interruptive to the viewing experience. The content owner remains in complete control of where and how the watermark appears on the video.

It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of project, cluster, namespace, and deployment - down to individual microservices. Infrastructure abstraction that makes DevOps 10x more productive CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit).
