StorPool converts sets of standard servers into primary storage systems for large-scale cloud infrastructure. The software comes as an utterly hands-off solution - we architect, deploy, tune, monitor, and maintain your StorPool Storage system so that your users experience a speedy and reliable service. StorPool Storage systems are ideal for storing and managing the data of primary workloads that demand extreme reliability and low latency - databases, web servers, virtual desktops, real-time analytics, and mission-critical software. StorPool simplifies our customers’ cloud infrastructure, removes all the pains they experienced with legacy storage products, and supercharges their revenue and profits. Our customers’ specific benefits from StorPool Storage vary depending on their use cases, technology stacks, and scale. However, the core capabilities of StorPool are that it is reliable, agile, managed with ease, utterly hands-off, and speedy. Under the hood, StorPool builds out shared-storage pools out of DC-grade storage drives directly attached to standard servers to create the ultimate storage solution. These pools provide standard block device interfaces to the virtualised, containerised, or bare-metal workloads running in a cloud. StorPool has native plug-ins for Cloud Management Platforms like OpenStack, OpenNebula, CloudStack, Kubernetes, and OnApp. It also supports VMware, Oracle VM, Hyper-V, XenServer, and almost all other technology stacks. We designed StorPool Storage for large-scale deployments, but it has efficient resource consumption and can start small. Each cluster scales seamlessly online - adding drives or servers expands both its capacity and performance. Adjusting StorPool volume size and performance also happens online without disrupting user workloads. The updates for StorPool are also carried out online, without any interruptions to your services.

r4apps GmbH,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/r4apps-gmbh,"Today data and information solutions reached its limits within many companies. Future challenges such as Big Data, Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 will only exacerbate the problems of IT departments. System solutions, which are not integrated are no longer meet the challenges. Against this background, innovative, high performing and flexible software solutions are needed worldwide. Correct handling of large volumes of data and integration across systems is therefore a crucial challenge for the coming years. In other words: The next technological leap is imminent. This is where the idea of NETBRIDGE starts. With NETBRIDGE, the company has developed an accelerated in-memory computing cloud-based semantic integration platform, to integrate the company-specific and partly insulated systems from different software vendors and gradually replace. One of the key ingredients includes a semantic layer as ultra-scalable and generic platform and graphical modeling tools as a basis for the development of a completely new dimension of standard business software (""SaaS-based software services""). Innovative element of the NETBRIDGE technology is the semantic, accelerated by graphics cards integration platform as well as the graphical modeling tools as a basis for the development of a new dimension of standard business software. The platform and the applications are based on modern frameworks and programming languages where it is extremely flexible and tailorable to each business processes. Due to the smart architecture and consistent SaaS approach, the development times and efforts are up to 70% shorter. Customers benefit from up to 60% shorter project duration and implementation efforts. The introduction of the semantic rule-layer simultaneously enables risk-free integration of existing software solutions - and thus the maximum investment protection for businesses - as well as the gradual replacement of legacy enterprise software by NETBRIDGE Business Suites. To solve the performance problems of today's ERP and data warehousing solutions cost-effectively, the company is one of the first providers to accelerated by graphics cards in-memory computing approach. Much faster and more flexible access to transactional data and mathematical calculations enable analytical reports on-the-fly. With NETBRIDGE it is the first time that transactional OLTP and analytical calculations OLAP are fully available at the same time and create flexible data queries without knowledge of the underlying data models.  Similar to what Google does with indices on websites and relevance sorting through PageRank, with this new technology based on superior computing power, the intelligent data model and the direct access to customer raw data, indexing of all files of the customer across systems and to do this automatically. In this way, the foundation stone for the parallel semantic data integration and migration is placed. Unlike today's data warehouse solutions dynamic queries and create customized BI reports in real time are possible at any time. The software which is based on web technologies (HTML5) was aligned from day one to mobile usage and adopts automatically to each device (responsive device). Thanks to the graphical specification language BPMN 2.0 business processes can flexibly and individually displayed and changes are quickly adjusted to the Business Suites. Software modifications are reduced to a minimum or eliminated completely. Gesture-controlled shortcuts also allow features that are unrealizable on the desktop. Through a platform API, partners and developers can use the full functionality of NETBRIDGE and develop discrete Business Suites. Technology, data model and architecture of NETBRIDGE already meet high demands on ERP solutions of the next generation, and thus the re-quirements for a best-in-class IT architecture: An ultra-scalable and fully integrated platform, Private-, hybrid and public cloud management, semantic, and Big Data-enabled technologies as well as a 512-bit encryption that goes beyond today's 128-bit standard addition. As a result, the customer benefits from extremely high performance, flexibility and safety as well as enormous cost savings.","Analytics, Cloud Infrastructure, Enterprise Software, Real Time, Software",http://www.r4apps.com,"Bietigheim-bissingen, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany",Cloud integrated collaboration Platform,"545,021",,,,,,,,,,,,,European Union (EU),Active,2012-07-13,day,,11-50,,,,,,
