Depending on the industry, LocationSmart can help with transportation, roadside services, proximity marketing, financial transaction verification and contact centers.  The History Behind LocationSmart  Originally, LocationSmart was founded under the name of TechnoCom Corporation in 1995. Its initial goal was to help wireless carriers with their mobile location requirements. Because of its innovative products and services, Deloitte chose TechnoCom as one of the top 50 fastest growing tech companies in Los Angeles for four years in a row.  In October 2010, LocationSmart was developed as a division of TechnoCom Corporation. Since it was initially founded, LocationSmart has worked to help people and businesses around the world with location-based services. This company currently has the largest American footprint of any business for location-based services. To make user adoption even easier, the company has pioneered innovative methods for gaining privacy consent.  In 2021, LocationSmart was ranked as the best cloud-based location service provider in the world according to Corporate Vision Magazine. Their services work across 15 billion devices around the world. What Can LocationSmart Do? LocationSmart offers a powerful platform for location determination that is designed to be cloud-based. This trusted service helps to raise an organization's business intelligence by delivering additional data, improving the company's operational efficiencies and lowering overall costs. LocationSmart's location-as-a-service platform also helps companies improve their customer engagement and security. It enables location based on IP address, cell or wi-fi ID, web browser and mobile app SDK. Businesses can also use options like LocationSmart's device profile and messaging services. The messaging option allows companies to create geo-enabled SMS, in-app messages and standalone campaigns. The two-way messaging involves complete SMS management that works with more than 60 different carriers. Meanwhile, the device profile option uses the cloud to conduct real-time device verification. Because of this, the device profile can help companies validate their returning customers and halt cybercriminals. This technique uses real-time risk scoring and behavior analytics to determine which devices may pose a risk for a company's security. With the geofencing and privacy features, businesses can ensure their clients' privacy and create geo-relevant campaigns. Geofencing helps companies create a radius for providing ads and other services. With LocationSmart's privacy features, businesses can include consent controls and reminders for their users. From advanced reporting requirements to world-class security, LocationSmart offers a variety of services for modern businesses and tech companies.","Cloud Data Services, Enterprise Software, Location Based Services, Logistics, Mobile, PaaS, SaaS, Wireless",https://www.locationsmart.com,"Carlsbad, California, United States",LocationSmart® is the leading provider of cloud-based location services for gaming geolocation compliance and IoT asset management.,"55,156","2,667","4,647.17",-11.04%,"1,164.04%","1,441",2,-42.86%,50%,0%,"4,453,310","374,159",9.17%,"Greater San Diego Area, West Coast, Western US",Active,1995-01-01,year,2,11-50,"Mario Proietti, Masoud Motamedi",1,,836172,USD,836172
