After inventing the mobile talk-plan concept in France in 1996, Bouygues Telecom has always been a pioneer in innovation: it introduced the first unlimited call plans with Millennium (1999) and Neo (2006); in 2007, it launched the first fixed-mobile convergence offer for corporate customers; in 2009, it invented the “all-in-one” solution with ideo, the first quadruple play offer in the market; and, as early as July 2011, it invented mobile telephony 2.0 with B&YOU, the first SIM-only Web-Only offer. In June 2012, Bouygues Telecom launched Bbox Sensation, its new range of routers packed with the most innovative technologies on the market that will transform the digital home experience and in November 2013, the Box Internet by B&YOU, a double-play which democratizes the access to Internet. In January 2014, Bouygues Telecom and SFR conclude a strategic agreement to share a part of their mobile access networks: it will enable both operators to provide their respective customers better coverage, better quality of service, and to generate significant savings. Its mobile network covers 99% of the French population with 2G, 96% with 3G+ and 60% with H+.

The companyâ€™s patent pending BitSpread encoding technology offers the scalability and ease-of-use of a next generation RAIN grid, creating a 10,000 times more reliable alternative to RAID.

Leveraging distributed storage technologies, Amplidata enables customers to build highly available storage infrastructures at significantly reduced cost.

Search returns many results that still need to be reviewed manually, and content management systems are often incompatible with the cloud storage paradigm. Cloudfind’s SaaS-based technology provides a much more effective solution to the problem of linking business processes with the right information from potentially millions of files, dramatically streamlining many day-to-day business processes.  For enterprise users and teams, Cloudfind incorporates a fundamentally new way to manage information. Cloudfind automatically tags information from cloud files in a more intelligent way than keyword search and without relying on user-specified tags.  Cloudfind is integrated with Salesforce.com, Google Drive, Box and DropBox, giving Sales users seamless access to cloud-based storage with the potential for dramatic productivity improvements.  Cloudfind works both directly with customers as well as with Salesforce.com implementation partners who incorporate its technology within larger solutions.
