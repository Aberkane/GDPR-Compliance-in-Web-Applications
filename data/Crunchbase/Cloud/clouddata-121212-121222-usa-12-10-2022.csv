DAtAnchor,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/datanchor,"Traditional IT controls focus on locking down networks, devices, and people. All of this is done in the name of protecting data. But, once files are moved, shared, or stolen, the data is no longer protected. Even worse, these controls get in the way and frustrate business users to the point they intentionally work around them. Anchor inverts the equation by baking protection into the data, invisible to the business users (like antivirus), so that files are free to travel and security is out of the way. Simply put, wherever the data goes, it is protected. Anchor is a SaaS platform, with an endpoint component, that bakes protection into your files with a unique transparent combination of encryption, continuous multi-factor access controls, and a digital chain of custody. And when you do share or collaborate, Anchor protection stays with your data, even when it leaves your organization. Anchor empowers you to maintain control of your files while collaborating on premise or in the cloud, including forensic logging and revoking access. In under 90 minutes, Anchor is fully deployed and empowers your business users to securely work and collaborate without complicated security products or rules in the way. All without requiring you to change existing IT controls or how your users and applications work today. DAtAnchor is a result of a multi-year research activity, developed at Ohio State University.

Terminal.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/terminal-com,"We built a hypercloud with bare-metal performance.  A hypercloud is a 100% software configurable virtual datacenter that lives on top of physical hardware securely in your private datacenter, on the public clouds of AWS, GCE, and Azure, and on your laptop. Virtual Machines tax performance.  Containers are too new and insecure, forcing you to redesign app deployment flow. The hypercloud unit of computation is the Terminal Machine (TM, or just Terminal).  TMs are the best of both worlds: you get the security and familiarity of full operating system instances with the bare-metal speed and efficiency of containers. TMs rebalance and migrate seamlessly without reboot to maximize efficiency of your cluster.  Terminals resize from 1 CPU to 32 CPUs and 50GB of RAM when you need the power, in seconds, with no reboot. They automatically pause or shrink back down to save you money. “The software-defined data center is 10 years away,” they say. “The public cloud is too insecure,” they say. The hypercloud is the best of both worlds: you get the abstraction and power of the cloud, with the security of running everything in your own datacenter, plus the benefits of a hybrid cloud if you want both. Today. Who uses Terminal.com? Our users range from web app developers who spin up copies of their website in 5 seconds for QA and testing, to neuroscientists who analyze large FMRI datasets on computers that scale instantly, to online schools who teach people how to code using Terminal.com. RailsBridge relies on Terminal.com to teach first-time female engineers to code Ruby on Rails.  Top consultants at ZS Associates crunch numbers on our platform for data science tasks every day.  Professors at Carnegie-Mellon use Terminal.com to teach 100-student courses with no wasted effort.  Engineers across Silicon Valley know that Terminal.com is the easiest and most powerful tool for conducting coding interviews. Terminal.com provides the full suite of tools for the modern developer. How did Terminal.com start? When Varun Ganapathi’s family moved from India to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980's, they started a small company called Terminal Exchange Systems. The company provided terminals to local companies so that they could remotely access huge, main-frame computers. Varun Ganapathi helped his father carry machines door to door, renting out both the hardware and software to local businesses. As he grew up, Varun’s commitment to computing didn’t disappear. He completed his computer science PhD at Stanford, sold over 1 million copies of his paid photography mobile app, Pro HDR, and sold his second company, Numovis, to Google. After two years as a Google Senior Research Scientist, Varun asked his father if he could use the company domain name, Terminal.com. Varun explained that he had plans for it, but this time there would be no need to carry hardware door to door. Today, Varun and his San Francisco-based team rent out browser-based virtual machines that they call Terminals to thousands of users across the globe giving them access to the infinite resources of the cloud. Users ranging from online education students to Dev-Ops professionals can now start, resize, and scale their own Terminals in a matter of seconds. Inside each Terminal, they discover an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and sharing programs. And they don’t even have to wait for them to be delivered to their door.","Cloud Data Services, Computer, Security, Software",https://www.terminal.com/,"San Francisco, California, United States",Terminal provides bleeding-edge software and AI to edtech companies looking to improve student success.,"34,856",808,,,,0,1.12,,88%,,"7,303,368",,,"San Francisco Bay Area, West Coast, Western US",Active,2013-01-01,year,4,11-50,"Danny Krause, Jeff Wu, Joseph Perla, Varun Ganapathi",,,,,

The TruMedicines Pill Recognizer can be used as a software service (SAAS) for mobile applications, to identify pills that have been registered in our database. Using GPS locator of the phone app, Pharmaceutical pills can be tracked/trace/authenticated in compliance with the 2013 US Drug Security Act!  Able to to identify billions of individual drug tablets using an android smartphone app now available on Amazon Apps https://goo.gl/m4WAhC Big Data Analytics for Big Pharma TruMedicines has patented a technology which allows a smartphone app to identify random patterns on drug pills. When a user scans a drug package barcode or pill, our 2 step, cloud based image recognition webservice performs image recognition matching to our image database on that drug tablet and provides text and audible information to the user-  What, when, where, expiration date, adverse reaction rate, adverse multi-drug reaction rate, customized messages from Drug Distributor. All data is in compliance with the 2013 Drug Security Act. (requires full track/trace compliance for all drugs sold in USA by 2017).   The Problems 1) Counterfeit Drugs  - National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) found in 2010 that 97 percent of the more than 10,900 Internet pharmacies were selling counterfeit drugs. The World Health Organization reports counterfeit drugs cause 1Mil deaths/year in developing countries, India, Africa, and Asia. In the United States a rising occurrence of 100,000 deaths/year are caused by adverse drug reactions, drug mistakes and overdoses. Peter Pitts, president of The Center for Medicine in the Public Interest and former FDA associate commissioner, estimates that in 2010, activities related to counterfeit drugs generated $75 billion, based on information obtained from government organizations. He expects it to grow by 20 percent annually in the coming years. If this estimate is correct, the counterfeit drug industry generates nearly as much cash as the world's fourth-largest wholesale drug company by revenue, AmerisourceBergen, which generated  $79 billion in 2012. 2) Non-compliance to drug therapy (USA) - The annual costs of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, are estimated to be $174 billion and $403 billion, respectively, in the United States. As these chronic disease costs continue to rise, managed care stakeholders and health insurance companies are continually looking for areas in which the quality of care can be improved and expenditures reduced. One such area is medication compliance, where increased compliance rates have demonstrated improved clinical outcomes and reduced overall medical expenditures.Source JMPC Jul 2008 vol 8 •	up to 90% of diabetes patients do not take their medication well enough to benefit from that medication. •	33-50% of some cancer patients take less of their anti-cancer medicine than required. •	only 75% of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients take sufficient medicine for it to be effective. •	Up to 75% of hypertensive patients do not adhere to their medicine. •	41-59% of mentally ill patients take their medication infrequently or not at all. •	33% of patients with schizophrenia don’t take their medicine at all, and 33% are poorly adherent. •	Less than 27% depressed patients adhere to their medication. The Solution TruMedicines has transformed drug tablets into data source points, which can be used for individual health improvement and collectively as a public health data source. TruMedicines is a “game changer” for how medicine is administered and how customers interact with medicine.

They are the only end-to-end solution for businesses that care about the security of their data in the cloud.

They combine all of this in a multi-platform system that is lightweight and transparent in your day-to-day operation.

Operational Precision Systems,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/operational-precision-systems,"O-P-S was founded to provide turn-key, cloud-based, environmental monitoring management solutions for agencies responsible for testing samples against mandated requirements, yet often don’t have the resources to maintain compliance with the complex regulations from the EPA and states, and are subsequently causing thousands of violations every year ($112m calculated). Our mission is to provide solutions to support the management of public infrastructure systems (Water, Waste, Air, and Land quality) to improve national safety. For example in the United States alone there are 155,000 public drinking water systems that supply water to 320 million people.  In 2011 (latest data), those suppliers were reported to have made 196,110 violations of the EPA regulations in regards to the Clean Water and Clean Drinking Water Act.  OPS is designing WaterOPS to manage the complex task of meeting regulatory requirements in harmony with daily operations.  Our approach is one of integrating all levels of system operations from field inspectors, laboratories, and management through an intuitive program breaking down complicated regulations into manageable daily tasks.  This scalable solution is capable of managing the operational needs for:- -Monitoring & recording hundreds of thousands of samples per day -Assimilating data into alerts and reports to rapidly inform key personnel -Provide information on trends and advisory notices -Even predict violations before they happen The core engine of our solution is being designed to support the entire USA water system network of drinking water providers, with a particular focus on providing an affordable service for the vast majority of system operators (143,000) that are still using outmoded paper based logging (over 60% in a recent market survey).  It will then be used to manage other crucial environmental monitoring systems impacting public safety, such as solid/water/hazardous waste, air quality, and land/agricultural/farm monitoring. Not only this, OPS is building a geo-referenced knowledgebase to help municipalities deal with the encroaching issue that 70% of Water Operators are now only within 5-7 years of retirement and have few resources to transfer that knowledge into a format for the next generation. We believe the solutions under development will even have worldwide advantages in supporting environmental monitoring in developing countries due to its cost-effectiveness.","Cloud Data Services, Information Technology",http://www.o-p-s.net/,"Salisbury, Maryland, United States",Environmental Monitoring In The Cloud.,"808,575",,,,,,,,,,,,,"East Coast, Southern US",Active,2015-03-01,day,5,1-10,"Charles Rowe, Evan Chou, LEE BEAUCHAMP, Matt Beard, Tim Gantzhorn",,,,,

Cloud computing power is now fundamental to any business, science, government, military affairs, and social activities – we cannot live without it – and it will be traded beyond the border as a commodity. Therefore, the meta-data generated by Baransu’s intelligent marketplace (i.e. the worldwide flow/price/ demand/supply/etc. of the computing power) can indicate the movement of the world, and the quickest knowledge about it will bring an invaluable advantage to the company who owns the marketplace. As well as providing substantial competition among users, providers and operators of the cloud in the future.  Furthermore, with the commoditization of cloud computing services this will raise a wide range of businesses and activities around the marketplace. Baransu can either partner with for mutual benefit, acquire or start as we see fit. It may include an insurance company who covers a failure of the service providers, a credit rating agency who evaluates the reliability and reputations of the providers, and an independent agency like the Securities and Exchange Commission who enforces fair trading on all the participants in the marketplace. Our proprietary and proven designs will certainly be the best mechanism to support fair trading among a variety of companies and citizens. CONTACT FOUNDER WITH QUESTIONS.
