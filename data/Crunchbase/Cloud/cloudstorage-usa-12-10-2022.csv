Memory Lane,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/memory-lane-2,"Vision: Memory Lane reminds users of their lives and histories by using voice computing to experience popular and personal memories stored in the cloud. Mission: Memories make us who we are. As we age, we collect billions of bits of memories. Sometimes, our physical and mental health causes us to lose sight of our memories which causes us to forget who we are. Thanks to easy to use technology like voice computing, we can now access our memories easily, reminding us of the great lives we led and sharing them with the younger generations to come.  Objectives: We empower active aging and longevity using software on voice computing platforms like Amazon’s Alexa to deliver reminiscence therapy. Our application Memory Lane is available for free on the Alexa skill store and uses historic audio clips to take visitors to any year from 1906 to present day. These recordings spark memories about what happened in the user’s life within a given year. Version 2 of Memory Lane will sync to a web interface to enable creation of unique personal memories uploaded by the individual (as a digital diary) or by loved ones who share reminiscences. Strategy: We are enabling voice computing in every room in every senior care facility in America. We can do this by creating a management system for voice computing devices and A.I. applications that provide customize experiences for aging individuals. Caregivers will have the ability to conduct daily tasks with greater ease, set up scheduling tasks and engage in activities. Our flagship product, Memory Lane, is ideal to help bring families closer together around the memories of the aging individual and be used in existing memory care programs throughout the country. Action Plans: We are working with four large organizations in New York and Vermont to pilot the use of Alexa in daily operations and host Memory Lane workshops to keep care-recipients engaged with each other, their caregivers, friends, and families. Our pilot will focus on feedback from caregivers, cognitively healthy seniors, those with early dementia, and then those with dementia.  In 2017, we will develop Memory Lane V2 with subscription and also develop for Google Assistant. We will continue to curate and expand the public Memory Lane library. We are establishing partnerships to run pilot studies in senior assisted living and memory care facilities. We are raising funds to pay our coders and complete our research study on Alexa & aging.","Apps, Cloud Storage, Software",http://memorylane.ai/,"Brooklyn, New York, United States","Your memories in the cloud, powered by voice","230,551",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",Active,2015-01-01,year,1,1-10,Andy Kropa,,,,,
