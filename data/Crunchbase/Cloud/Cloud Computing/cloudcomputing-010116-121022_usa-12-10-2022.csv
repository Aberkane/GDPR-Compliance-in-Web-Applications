CAST AI intelligent optimization engine delivers a cost-efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructure for every Kubernetes workload.  Cloud Cost optimization  CAST AI brings resource and cost optimization to Kubernetes using an AI-driven optimization engine that applies cluster changes based on real-time workload conditions. It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of project, cluster, namespace, and deployment - down to individual microservices. Infrastructure abstraction that makes DevOps 10x more productive CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit). Foolproof outage prevention with cloud neutrality, multi-cloud and multi-region capabilities CAST AI protects workloads against downtime with a Disaster Avoidance strategy based on cloud neutrality and multi-cloud capabilities. To achieve 100% uptime, CAST AI adopts the active approach to Disaster Recovery by stretching applications and data across multiple clouds so that a cloud failure never becomes a disaster.

CCT,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cct-d9fc,"Cibao Cloud Technologies (CCT) is an Information and Communications Technology startup specializing in leveraging the power of Artificial Intelligence, Predictive Analytics, and Modeling to improve the performance of their clients’ assets and operations. Simply stated, they work with you to obtain better results from your existing data and connected enterprise assets. For many organizations, blindly collecting massive amounts of data and storing it in hyperscale databases does not lead to better outcomes. They have found that the solution is to design models and write software programs that, to the extent possible, produce the desired behavior from a small set of instructions rather than a vast table. The result is better conversion rates of data monetization, simpler operations, and faster time to solutions. There are many examples showing that this can be done successfully. For example, the huge tables of square roots used by engineers in the 1970s have now been replaced by a simple five-line program on electronic calculators. The question is, can they leverage AI to do the same to solve their most immediate business and operational problems? They know the answer is yes. Through the application of simple, model-based, goal, utility, and learning agents, they can maximize the expected value of any performance metric. Automated algorithms can improve the agent's behavior through diligent study of their own experiences, after making observations about their environment.","Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Information Technology, Machine Learning",https://www.cibaocloud.com,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States",Cibao Cloud Technologies (CCT) is an Information and Communications Technology.,"801,494",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",Active,2017-01-01,year,,1-10,,,,,,

Cloud computing power is now fundamental to any business, science, government, military affairs, and social activities – we cannot live without it – and it will be traded beyond the border as a commodity. Therefore, the meta-data generated by Baransu’s intelligent marketplace (i.e. the worldwide flow/price/ demand/supply/etc. of the computing power) can indicate the movement of the world, and the quickest knowledge about it will bring an invaluable advantage to the company who owns the marketplace. As well as providing substantial competition among users, providers and operators of the cloud in the future.  Furthermore, with the commoditization of cloud computing services this will raise a wide range of businesses and activities around the marketplace. Baransu can either partner with for mutual benefit, acquire or start as we see fit. It may include an insurance company who covers a failure of the service providers, a credit rating agency who evaluates the reliability and reputations of the providers, and an independent agency like the Securities and Exchange Commission who enforces fair trading on all the participants in the marketplace.
