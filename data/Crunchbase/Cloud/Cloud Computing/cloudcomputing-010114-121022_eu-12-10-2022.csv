Our goal is to disrupt conventional clouds with distributed edge computing. We provide the software to unify all edge clouds and broker the capacity of all infrastructure with zero CAPEX. CloudBackend uniquely ties together Edge Cloud Computing and Serverless Computing and completely removes the need of running your own code at the edge. By providing a no touch edge that automatically makes data available on demand whenever requested, the cloud can finally become industrialized. Customers in industries such as telecom, automotive, consumer electronics, industrial automation, and IoT, are actively searching for a solution to gather and process, manage, and synchronize data across the edge. Several companies are building Edge Cloud Computing Infrastructure and CloudBackend provides the technology that makes it possible for them to become part of the Edge Platform as a Service marketplace, where end-customers can buy capacity from a single legal entity and have an abstraction layer that removes all the complexities by having numerous underlying infrastructures and technologies. We believe we can make edge cloud computing the new default, the go to mainstream technology to make anything cloud related. Why build something for a purely centralized cloud, when you can build it native for the edge and enjoy reduced latency, a better user experience and world-wide coverage from day 1?

ThreeB IT,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/threeb-it-gmbh,"We are a startup from Ibbenbüren that has turned our passion for software development into a profession. We currently consist of Thimo Buchheister and Thorsten Brügge, who have been working together as software engineers for a long time and who decided in 2019 to make the world of digital processes accessible to everyone. As CEO, Thimo Buchheister is currently primarily involved in the development of our ThreeNamic platform. With his many years of experience as a software engineer and in-depth knowledge of mobile and cloud development, software engineering, databases, blockchain and IT project management, he has an overview of the big picture and always keeps the company and our products at the forefront of current technologies. As COO, Thorsten Bruges is our creative and communicative mind. He is responsible for the development of our products and is in constant contact with our customers and partners. With his experience in machine learning, he is also responsible for the automation of ThreeNamic's processes. Through his experience in industry and in sales, Thorsten has an important perspective on the necessary functionality of our products and advises our customers on all aspects of our products, projects and the company. There are a number of software solutions on the market that support entrepreneurs in capturing the data necessary for their everyday work and making adjustments. Most offers here have in common that the user has to submit to the procedures prescribed by the program or that the software only displays a snapshot. Our vision is software that can be adapted to the needs of the user and that also accompanies and documents the entire process. We would also like to create the possibility of accessing the processes from anywhere in order to enable modern and location-independent work. Today this is only possible if an entrepreneur can raise the necessary capital to have customized software programmed. With ThreeNamic, we want to give every entrepreneur - regardless of type and size - the opportunity to adapt a software solution to their needs. Our customers should concentrate on their core competencies and know that our software is the perfect digital partner by their side. In many conversations we have heard that digital developments in many companies are still in their infancy and that those responsible are facing major challenges. Most companies already have processes that have proven themselves over long periods of time. The introduction of new software is then not only the transfer of data into a new system, but in most cases also an adaptation of current processes to the processes specified by the new system. We want to be the solution here. Our goal is to enable every company to become more efficient with the help of digitization. We enable the smallest start-up to the largest company to digitize all corporate processes on a global scale and thus work more effectively, transparently and securely. Starting with training for customers and employees, the planning and organization of events or meetings, through the digitization of training and further education to the complete automation of critical company processes, with ThreeNamic we have the appropriate solution.","Blockchain, Cloud Computing, Cloud Data Services, Image Recognition, Industrial Automation, Information Technology, SaaS, Software",https://threebit.io,"Ibbenbüren, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany",ThreeB IT is a german startup that runs a digital process management and automation SaaS platform for corporations of any industry and size.,"154,579","1,470","5,614.67",-90.48%,"1,300%",34,2,100%,0%,37.12%,"6,229,180","4,516,858",263.79%,European Union (EU),Active,2019-03-01,day,2,1-10,"Thimo Buchheister, Thorsten Brügge",,,,,

Paytailor is far more than just Mobile payment solution, enabling users to access multiple services beyond the scope of the ​mobile payment as such. Paytailor solves two very fundamental problems, millions of businesses globally face. These are accessibility and costs, fuelled by cash payments and card terminals. Both expensive, and limiting the ability to choose how and where to accept payments. Most mobile payment solutions require integrations, card terminals or additional hardware. So, those ways of payment don’t really solve any problems or create new values. For merchants, it’s an investment in hardware that does not yield any new payment scenarios. They are still tied down to the same location, the same customers and the same card payment. Only the mechanics (swipe vs. chip vs. tap) vary from solution to solution.  Paytailor replaced physical payment with virtual, which means everything is entirely on the cloud. This enables to accept payments in multiple ways, allowing businesses to choose the most beneficial for their business. We can onboard merchants in 8 minutes virtually and they can start accepting payments with an existing device and bank account, no integrations needed. Paytailor also has a public API which allows simple and fast integration with PoS systems, in-app e-commerce and IoT payments (which means we can make devices, doors, gates, machines etc to accept mobile payments).

Paytailor acts as a payment aggregator, which means different payment methods in addition to credit or debit card (mobile carrier billing, PSD2 open banking- direct debiting, top-up solutions, even cryptocurrencies etc).
