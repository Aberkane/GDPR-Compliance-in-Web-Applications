RxVantage,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rxvantage,"RxVantage is OpenTable.com for pharma reps (and other medical vendors) looking to access physicians.  The company's cloud-based platform improves patient outcomes and enhances the relationship between medical representatives and physicians’ offices.  The Problem:  The pharmaceutical industry spends $60 billion per year marketing, most of which is directed to the physicians who determine how the $325 billion that Americans spend each year on prescription drugs will be allocated. These marketing dollars go toward reaching docs at the point of care via sales reps that provide free samples and educational materials for patients, and medical education to doctors and their staff. All pharma brands must be in the practice if they hope to succeed. The last decade has seen an explosion of novel medical technologies and treatments, along with a corresponding increase in the number of reps promoting them. More than 130,000 reps visit the 30,000 busiest medical practices every day. These practices see value in what individual reps deliver, however, they are often overwhelmed by a community of reps that cannot organize itself to fit the practices’ schedules and priorities.   In an attempt to control the rep chaos, these practices often dedicate hundreds of staff hours per year to coordinating rep visits on handwritten paper calendars and business cards. With pharma having demonstrated more than a 1000% ROI on such visits, far higher than any other sales/marketing channel, demand for access far outstrips supply.  Despite this high demand, more than 30% of these appointments are abandoned by the scheduled rep and go unfilled, a paradox that occurs because: 1. Appointments are booked up to one year in advance by reps that must be in the practice. 2. Rep turnover is high, and territories and physician targets are constantly realigned. 3. Appointment information is locked inside tens of thousands of individual paper calendars. Unfortunately, the burden on staff time and the high rate of “no-show” appointments can lead a practice to reduce rep access to their doctors, or, eliminate it all together. As a result, the most effective channel pharma has to educate doctors about new treatments is becoming a victim of its own success.  Enter RxVantage:  Our technology enables practices to control the flow of reps in their office without utilizing staff time, which can then be re-focused on patients. Putting the practice back in control empowers them to remain open to receiving the valuable education and services that reps provide. This is especially important given studies showing that physicians not seeing reps are 4X slower to react to new information, both positive (i.e. new standard of care) and negative (i.e. product recall). In addition to keeping the practices’ doors open, RxVantage creates more opportunities for reps within each practice. By freeing the appointment data from the cages of the paper calendars, we apply our innovative technology to every appointment in order to predict and eliminate “no-shows” before they happen. By enabling other reps to book these appointments that otherwise would have been wasted, RxVantage makes the sales forces that call on our medical practices 30% more productive. More than 11,000 reps from 400 companies have used RxVantage to book over 120,000 appointments with 1,200 practices containing 4,000 high-prescribing physicians. At this scale the company has created more than $100MM in value for pharma by virtue of the 40,000+ appointments that would not have occurred in the absence of our technology. In the next 18 months, as new financing allows us to ramp this proven sales process and support the channel partnerships that we have negotiated, the value we create for pharma will exceed $1BB across a network that includes 50,000 physicians. The RxVantage platform includes a dedicated online medical rep scheduling calendar, a communication hub that enables practices to efficiently interact with reps, a sample request tool, up-to-date directory of patient assistance programs, and a drug coupon database.","Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software, Health Care, Medical, Software",http://www.rxvantage.com,"Culver City, California, United States",RxVantage provides cloud-based software that enables efficient communication of medical practices.,"117,100","23,849","20,847.5",-0.55%,-59.55%,161,2.04,-9.32%,46.21%,-8.82%,"1,378,209","40,859",3.06%,"Greater Los Angeles Area, West Coast, Western US",Active,2008-01-01,year,4,11-50,"Daniel Gilman, Greg Gilman, James Dwyer, Jeremy Gilman",,,,,

With over 15,000 users, Security Anywhere was effective and successful, but more importantly, it served as a proving ground for Bat Blue’s next generation of security solutions which would eliminate reliance on proxy technologies which are limited, complex, finicky and don’t scale. It also drove home the importance of the proper formulations for latency and throughput to achieve the instantaneous and transparent experience users demand. With this experience, Pasdar and the Bat Blue team architected the Cloud/Sec platform that is fast, intelligent, secure and ubiquitous.

Infinetics Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/infinetics,"Infinetics has designed and implemented Long Hop™, a high performance network connection architecture that provides significantly better tradeoffs between bandwidth, latency, fault tolerance and cost than previously known approaches. Long Hop networks are more cost efficient than a fat-tree, supporting at least 50% more servers using the same network hardware while providing equivalent bandwidth and improved latency of at least 25%. Oversubscription and fault tolerance can also be smoothly varied to meet cost and performance goals. Long Hop’s regular wiring patterns maximize the number of short connections and minimize the number of long distance connections between server rows or containers, thereby reducing cabling costs and simplifying expansion by reducing or eliminating rewiring. Long Hop networks well serve the needs of modern data centers by providing consistent bandwidth under varying load conditions via extensive multi-path support and automatic load balancing, allowing mobile workloads to be placed without regard to available bandwidth, and allowing services to be isolated in a multi-tenant environment to match the business needs of customers.  Long Hop achieves this by combining patent-pending wiring methods with a simple high-performance, TCAM-efficient forwarding method well suited to the current generation of network switch hardware and SDN controllers supporting OpenFlow or proprietary southbound APIs. The wiring method starts with a highly symmetrical framework well suited to economical, fault tolerant switching, and overlays another symmetrical network of short cuts that simultaneously amplify available bandwidth as well as reduce latency. The end result gives the ability to design and construct networks that precisely meet implementation-specific business needs.","Cloud Computing, Developer Platform, Enterprise Software",http://www.infinetics.com,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States","Infinetics develops network architecture and software products such as the Long Hop, a high performance network connection architecture.","239,567",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",Active,2009-01-01,year,1,11-50,Anthony Antonuccio,,,,,

Posting and validating a work is a free service to help creators and their representatives organize a portfolio of the lifeâ€™s work of an author. Premium subscriptions provide access to services that will benefit all stakeholders in a work. Our Beta release allows creators with an interest in a work to add a work to the registry. The registry will automate email communication to all creators associated with a work. The communications contain a hyperlink to access MyWerx on the web. An easy to use interface for validating critical information like titles, author names and their ownership interests make reaching agreement on the creatorsâ€™ splits a simple step for everyone. No one can see or access any data unless they have a validated ownership interest. Each step in the validation process requires consensus of the parties. Subsequent releases will allow storing and communicating with business representatives of a work and track copyright ownership transfers throughout the life cycle of a registered work. Correct ownership and representative information is increasing in necessity because of the growing number of internet users creating and exposing their copyrighted works. Copyright viability and value is at risk when the market interested in using them must invest hours of time tracking down the owners or licensing agents to obtain permission.

Their flagship product DevDesk Tabz is being introduced as a SaaS platform where companies and individuals can find, organize and share online apps & URLs while accessing these favorite applications from a single interface.  Tabz provides the ability to create corporate marketplaces where employee application administration can be consolidated or public-facing partnership portals can be promoted. The Tabz platform is the first step in creating an environment for corporate chain supply management: equipping companies to intuitively manage access rights and permissions to granular levels thus controlling varying degrees of transparency for sharing information with their unique audiences.  The product introduces companies to a variety of applications aimed at facilitating business development and operations while providing the flexibility to incorporate existing legacy systems or bespoke corporate portals into the environment.  The Tabz platform thereby facilitates the creation of custom integrations and migrations between disparate apps, cloud-based environments and on-premise hardware or software which ultimately leads to higher employee adoption of evolving technologies. DevDesk will be introducing modules to further promote the consolidation, visualization and tracking of data across multiple companies and technologies: a concept they have coined ""Multi-Business Management"" (MBM).  The primary goal of their MBM suite of tools is to manage multiple businesses, subsidiaries, trades, brands and independent operations from a single source.  Core modules such as CRM, Salesforce, Property, Project and Document Management are being introduced to address this goal and revolve around their founding principles of â€œconnecting people, places and projectsâ€.

ScopiaRx,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/scopiarx,"At ScopiaRx we make complex medication safety simple. Whether you take 5, 10, or 20 medications ScopiaRx helps you, your caregivers, and your providers make sure those treatments are safe for you. The idea for ScopiaRx came to Dr. Jeffrey Huth while helping a family member manage her 12 different prescriptions. Like millions of patients, the number of her prescriptions kept creeping up to address new chronic conditions and symptoms. One day, a tipping point was reached, and she just did not feel well.  Jeff has a deep background in both the science and clinical considerations of medication safety. Despite this, it literally took him hours of work to look up all of the information for 12 medications and compare that to the specific traits of one patient. What he also discovered was that there are millions of case reports about side effects from people just like his family member, but that none of this information was at the finger tips of the doctors who were prescribing her medications.  The message was clear. Patients are routinely being prescribed 10, 15, and even 20 medications without a thorough evaluation of drug safety. Why is this happening? It is because physicians and pharmacists do not have the tools that would allow them to do this complicated risk evaluation in the short amount of time that they have with a patient.   For the next five years, Jeff developed a method to put all of this safety and clinical information together in such a way that a computer program could do what takes a trained clinician hours to accomplish. During his work in hospitals and clinics, he talked to fellow physicians and pharmacists about their struggles with drug safety management for complex cases. They discussed numerous product ideas and came up with the core features of ScopiaRx","Cloud Computing, Health Care",http://scopiarx.com,"Cincinnati, Ohio, United States",Personalized Medication Safety Software,"1,154,180",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Great Lakes, Midwestern US",Active,2008-02-01,day,,11-50,,,,,,
