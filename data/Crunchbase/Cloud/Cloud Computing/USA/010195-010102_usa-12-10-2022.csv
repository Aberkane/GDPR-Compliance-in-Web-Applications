From the beginning, they had a clear vision to build a company with a focus on reliability, development, and outstanding people. In its early years, Concord focused on the delivery of internet-based fax and messaging solutions for small business. In the mid-2000s they decided to reconfigure its business after they recognized an emerging need for enterprise-grade reliability and integration capabilities for large businesses who were making the transition from on-premise fax servers to a cloud-based solution. To serve these highly regulated businesses, they decided to re-architect their network to provide the highest available standard of reliability and security. Knowing that any outages or network issues could result in significant losses to their customers, they committed to building a network with 2-layers of redundancy in an active-active architecture, between dual data centers.
