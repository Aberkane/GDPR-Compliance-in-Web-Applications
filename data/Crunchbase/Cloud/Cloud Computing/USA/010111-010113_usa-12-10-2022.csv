Early in 2012, two of their founders, both engineers, were conducting an energy conservation project for a local school district.

Their founders began searching for software capable of scheduling preventive maintenance to ensure energy savings, streamlining event scheduling to minimize the running time of HVAC systems, and tracking and responding to heating/cooling complaints to meet the needs of the school staff. Many of the software solutions they explored were feature rich but way too complicated. This unmet need for an easy-to-use but functional system inspired their founders to create a solution of their own. After developing the first version of a tool to enhance the energy project, they realized the benefits that such a solution could provide to a wider customer base—and FMX was born!

Sookbox,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sookbox,"Sookbox provides a universal framework to connect and control media on all devices.  The goal of Sookbox is to empower users to enjoy their media on whatever device they choose, from the palm of their hand. At Sookbox, media access is organized by user, rather than by device or service. Devices should do what they are best at doing. Movies should be watched on a television, not a laptop. Music should be listened to through an amp and speakers, not computer speakers. And the remote control for everything should be a smartphone or tablet. The problem is that communication between these media outlets is difficult and onerous. Sookbox gives a cross-platform universal solution that goes beyond putting a smart app on a smart TV. Sookbox breaks from traditional thinking in two crucial ways: First is to put a cloud into homes, and the second is to serve content and controls separately. Sookbox provides a novel type of cloud service. The Sookbox uses stored or streamed content. It allows users to have their own physical server in their homes. This server, the Sookbox, allows a user to store content in their own ""personal cloud."" That is music, digital movies, and pictures on a single server. This idea is not unique, but it is powerfully packaged: media storage, distribution, and control - all centralized and layered in a single device. That gives you the power to use your iPhone to click “Goodfellas. Basement TV.” The core of the product line, the software of the cloud server, is a revolutionary type of web application development platform known as Harmony.  The current paradigm is a world where content and controls are in the same place. For example, the YouTube video controls are right next to the video and the back button is across the browser. Sookbox transcends that paradigm. Televisions are best for video, speakers are best for sound, and handheld devices are best for control. Now that Sookbox divides the cloud by user, it makes sense to serve multiple, different sites from a single web app. A fundamental Sookbox feature is that it does not compete with other cloud services or try to debunk them. Instead, it gives them a platform and a vessel to reach their current users in a friendlier, more powerful way. Harmony unleashes applications such as Pandora, Netflix and YouTube across a user’s home. For example, someone might want to develop a “Pandora Alarm Clock” app. The API allows developers to provide a single, connective user experience synchronized across multiple types of devices. On the developers' side, the Harmony libraries and structure allow them to serve independently content to content device(s) and controls to controlling device(s). By facilitating this two-way communication, Sookbox allows the navigation of media, the play/pause, volume, etc. to be displayed graphically on the handheld device and directly control the music coming out of the speakers. Sookbox can be viewed as a personal cloud. Personal meaning the user owns it personally, but also it is personalized. The cloud should be divided by user, not by device or by service. Sookbox opens a new layer between the other cloud services and the user that makes the experience personal and meaningful.","Cloud Computing, Content, Music, Software, Video",http://sookbox.com,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States",Sookbox is a cross-platform that enables users to virtually connect and control media from a handheld device.,"173,349",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater Boston Area, East Coast, New England",Active,2011-05-01,day,3,1-10,"Cyrus Vafadari, David Sukoff, Mathew Peterson",2,,,,

Traken Technologies,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/traken-technologies,"Traken Technologies, LLC is a Phoenix based, veteran owned Technologies Company developing an access control system with a secure mobile-cloud processing system. Initially focusing on preventing access to un-secured alcoholic beverages and to help local convenience stores reduce loss due to theft. While increasing convenience, future revenues and safety of the retailers and their customers. Traken has engineered and developed the HopsLock™ ID Verification System for use by retailers of beer. The HopsLock™ device serves as a deterrent to would be beer thieves by leveraging the responsibility of access to the beer coolers to the customers of the retail stores and taking the burden off employees and managers.  After querying several local convenience store locations in a major chain throughout the valley we have discovered that beer theft, on average accounts for approximately $7,000 per quarter and some locations have reported upwards of $30,000 in theft per quarter.  By combining our current system with the MOBICLOUD and utilizing the IP's algorithm we will be able to store/retrieve the data from each swipe of an ID. This information can then be SECURELY and wirelessly transmitted and retrieved anywhere from the secure cloud. This data will be used in several ways to include: Prosecution of crimes committed against retailers, data collection and analysis of market, specific target advertisement based on collected data. The aforementioned features will initially create an immediate deterrent to those who commit beer theft crimes against retailers.The evolution of the IP will allow future products to be accessed remotely and securely which will give us a unique ability to safely retrieve customer's data without the risk of identity theft. The secure wireless abilities allow us to cut costs during installation by eliminating the dependence of wired devices and onsite hard drives. By lowering our cost we directly lower our customers cost and are capable of delivering a superior product at appropriate prices.","Cloud Computing, Information Technology, Security",http://www.trackentech.com,"Scottsdale, Arizona, United States",Mobile Cloud Access Control Security,"1,019,808",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater Phoenix Area, Western US",Closed,2013-01-01,year,3,1-10,"Joshua J.

EMG Live Fitness,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/emg-live-fitness,"About EMG Live Fitness EMG Live Fitness is a platform/website where the most sought after fitness instructors are linked with the fitness enthusiast while not actually being in the same physical location.  EMG Live Fitness is a technological breakthrough for the fitness industry.  The evolution of Live broadcasts available on the web has made it possible for EMG to bring the most sought after instructors virtually out of their studios and live to any town, city or borough in the country, or world.   Full length classes physically held in places like New York City, Los Angeles and Amsterdam, by world renowned instructors, are now available to everyone around the globe in real time.  When the at home student joins a class that is being broadcast live from a gym or studio, he/she becomes a member of an even larger national and possibly global community taking the class.  EMG hosts discussion boards and chats for users to share their experiences, ask questions and make suggestions, just like they would at a physical space. EMG is taking advantage of a growing trend away from â€œbig box gymsâ€, and towards more â€œsingular eventâ€ classes (like Yoga and Cycling) which are being held in standalone studios.  They are providing the platform and portal, by which, students can now select from multiple genres without commitment to a singular gym and without travelling from place to place.  EMG will not be charging for memberships, registration fees or administrative costs, just the cost of the classâ€¦on a pay-per-view basis.    By having full length classes available both live and on-demand, there are no more excuses.   EMG Live Fitness is a woman owned company and is based in New Jersey. EMG Live Fitness was founded by former Fortune 100 senior executive, Joyce Wells, a resident of Hamburg, New Jersey.  She is bringing the fitness studio online.  EMG Live Fitness is a technological breakthrough for the fitness industry.  The evolution of live broadcasts available on the web has made it possible for EMG to bring the most sought after instructors out of their studios and virtually live to any town, city or borough in the country, or world.   She is running this business, with her partner, who resides an hour away.  They use Microsoftâ€™s cloud platform to store and share files, video chat, instant message and email.  The cloud platform has made it possible for them to have a truly virtual office.  This enables each of them to make the most out of one of their most valuable assets â€“ their home.   When asked why she wanted to start this business and why she chose to do it from home, she replied â€œI love my home in the hills of New Jersey, and knew that in this age of technology, I could be just as productive from my home, if not more.  As to starting this particular business, I am a fitness enthusiast and just could not find the time to get to the gym, nor did I want to be boxed into certain time periods when I could take my favorite class.  I combined my expertise in video sharing, fitness and business to form this enterprise.â€ â€œAs I expand, I expect to employ other at home workers as much as possible.â€","Cloud Computing, Fitness, Software",http://www.emglivefitness.com,"Hamburg, New Jersey, United States",EMG Live Fitness is a platform that enables fitness instructors to connect with the fitness enthusiasts online.,"1,660,517",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater New York Area, East Coast, Northeastern US",Active,2011-05-27,day,,1-10,,,,,,

"Engineered Magik, Inc",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/engineered-magik-inc,"e-Magik is a cyber security startup addressing secure connectivity, whether it’s our businesses, our phones, our homes or cars – made by Apple, MS, Intel, Google or Samsung…Mobility is no longer the point. Mobility is expected. Securing this connectivity is the point! This is why we developed “Fluid security” — eM-Connect™. The entire eM-Connect™ ecosystem was designed and developed with you in mind. “User Experience” really matters! End users want what they know and know what they want. Sysadmins face layers upon layers of complex systems and tasks. Service provider margins are tight, complexity is really expensive. Developers need a flexible, secure connectivity “snap in” to simplify development. We've made secure connectivity accessible and simple, by focusing on the entire ecosystem’s User Experience. The eM-Connect™ platform addresses modern “Web Scale” systematic approaches to provide scalable, distributed, secure, and reliable connectivity services. To be clear “Web Scale” is not an acronym for “Big” It’s about dynamics, like: what to scale, when to scale and where to scale, based on: users, content, location, network stability and hardware status. Our “fluid security” methods let eM-Connect™ scale from SME to Google levels because of design. Our new system of flexible secure connectivity solutions provides, at runtime, encapsulation of existing internet and network transport protocols, allowing existing applications, resources and services to benefit from our secure connectivity methods without needing to redevelop these programs. Our “Snap-In” provides a simple secure development environment to bring new, disruptive products to market in the fields of financial services, healthcare, entertainment, IoT and many others.","Cloud Computing, Mobile, Security",http://www.e-magik.com/,"Greensboro, North Carolina, United States",Returning security and privacy to the Internet.,"1,671,465",,,,,,,,,,,,,"East Coast, Southern US",Closed,2013-01-01,year,2,1-10,"Craig Damon, Jimi Jorgensen",,,,,

Our proprietary artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms hoover up information from all over the Web. We then apply the science of service quality to transform that data into actionable intelligence. The result is a performance report that is free of the inherent human bias so common in other cloud provider review sites and analyst reports. FY/c's reporting does this by looking at all of the evidence to come up a determination of service performance. FY/c also uses it's algorithms to help buyers figure out which attributes -- not features -- of a cloud service such as high security or 24/7 support are right for them. This needs assessment tool asks buyers a series of questions that focus not on particular feature set but on the appropriateness of the service for their company. This knowledge helps buyers choose the right provider for their needs, not on their wants. As cloud-provided software and services become the norm, choosing the right cloud provider can mean the difference between a business reaching its goals or not.

KloudStat,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kloudstat,"Analyze big data with R in the cloud (or iPad) #rstats #hadoop Today, big data is the crucial in many applications areas from academic to businesses. Dealing with big data is not an easy issue. It is not only about the statistical software, we have the open source R, and the powerful hardware, we can easily have 1000 of instances with cloud providers; it is all about the ease-of-use, the cost and the experience.  Commercial cloud providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) promote its simple and fast access to general computing and hosting. But this is not true for most of the academicians and enterprises. You need at least an expert to spend some hours to setup the R statistical environment before your analysis. And it is just an instance. If you have computation intensive analysis, you will need a cluster of sereval instances with different layers of big data stacks. All the installation and configuration are becoming more and more complex. We’re just data analysts. We just want to focus on data analysis. Why is it so hard? And end out nothing after some days of hardwork and resources wasted? KloudStat, a cloud integrated development environment for open source R, provides the academicians and enterprises the platform to perform and focus on big data analytic processes that are critical in decision making without dealing with the backend production environment, such that KloudStat as a fast, scalable, distributed system can start with on a single server within a minute and expand to a cluster of instances optimized for each tier, i.e. R clusters, Hadoop clusters, databases and application servers of the system automatically.  Besides giving the freedom of data intelligence to everyone at anywhere, anytime across multiple platforms, KloudStat’s collaboration feature allows a small group of collaborators can interact and do statistical analyses real-time with the virtual console, finally the source editing while all will be completely synchronize with local R software.  KloudStat’s most interesting feature would be the modules or more advanced, big data applications development, which allows developers to implement the statistics engine in R with KloudStat APIs, while envolved in a top layer defined like a user interface. The main layer coordinates the lower layers where different engines based on several architectures are implemented. Each modules or applications created that contains many features are for specific task or purpose. These modules or apps allows faster data analysis and for everyone even don’t have programming knowledge.  KloudStat was built based on Rstudio server with pre-configured big data stacks, such as Hadoop. You can start analyzing your data as soon as you login to your console dashboard, no cluster configuration needed as all is automated and optimized. So far, the user had to start his R session with special MPI command. MPI binding is automatically created in the background and you can start your computer cluster using the packages snow, Rmpi or foreach without any additional steps.
