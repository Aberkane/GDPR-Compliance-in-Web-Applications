miniNodes,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mininodes,"miniNodes are tiny dedicated servers that run Linux on ARM processors.  miniNodes can perform the same functions as a regular server, at a fraction of the cost and power used by a normal server. Available with either 32 or 64-bit ARM processors similar to those in smartphones and tablets, miniNodes can host cloud services and applications, serve websites, crunch big data, provide failover capacity, run IoT services, and more. Why miniNodes ARM Dedicated Servers? Microservers have several advantages over traditional servers and cloud servers: Microservers use drastically less power than a traditional server, helping save energy and the environment. Microservers are less expensive to own and operate than a traditional server. Microservers are physical hardware nodes allocated only to you, and are not shared or hosted in a cloud. Thus your data is isolated and security is superior to virtual machines. Further, ARM Dedicated Servers are great for developers, students, and web designers: Developers building mobile apps for Android, iOS, and Windows RT can build, test, and deploy code on the same ARM Cortex architecture that most mobile phones and tablets run on. An ARM Dedicated Server can be used to verify code runs properly on the ARM platform, or to host back-end services for mobile apps. Students can use ARM dedicated servers to learn Linux, system administration, hosting, and programming while taking classes and gaining skills. Because they are inexpensive, microservers are a great learning platform and educational tool. Web designers can use a microserver as a cost effective way to host customer websites. This is an example of “right-sized” computing, where the largest, fastest, most expensive server isn’t necessary to handle low-traffic, non-resource intensive websites. A microserver is sufficient, and is a much more cost effective way to host sites.","Cloud Computing, Web Hosting",http://www.mininodes.com,"Phoenix, Arizona, United States","miniNodes develops ARM dedicated servers that helps its users’ hosts cloud services, websites, and applications.","774,387","2,582","2,945.5",-5.46%,-86.32%,0,1,-55.86%,100%,18.79%,"4,526,517","268,210",6.3%,"Greater Phoenix Area, Western US",Active,2013-11-04,day,1,1-10,David Tischler,,,,,

Cloudtools,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudtools,"Based in Austin Texas, Cloudtools was founded in 2014. The story of Cloudtools actually begins earlier at Virtual Bridges, an established player in the virtualization space and the source company from which Cloudtools spun out. At the time, Virtual Bridges was bringing a new product to market, a cloud orchestration solution for orchestrating workloads in multi-cloud environments. During the development period they ran into the same roadblock that Cloudtools customers encounter every day: the time-consuming and difficult task of moving a virtual machine from one environment to another. Virtual Machine movement has been next to impossible yet it is a problem affecting any administrator who has a need to move to a different virtualization platform. We had an advantage when it came to dealing with this roadblock: our development team was dev-ops focused. We had developers who approached this problem with a deep understanding of the operational aspects of virtualization, and had first-hand experience dealing with real-world virtualization problems such as moving VMs. At this point we decided to solve the movement problem once and for all. This is when we formed Cloudtools and created Shift, the drag and drop solution that lets you move any virtualized machine from anywhere to anywhere. Shift is our first product to market that helps to solve the tough problems faced by cloud and virtualization administrators every day. Whether you need a tool that lets you switch to AWS, switch to Hyper-V, switch to Azure or you are having problems or issues with VMware or just want to move to the cloud, Cloudtools has developed the solution to help you. At Cloudtools, our mission is simple: We make tools that let IT professionals spend a few minutes handling tasks that would otherwise take hours or days.","Cloud Computing, Software, Virtualization",http://www.cloudtoolsonline.com,"Austin, Texas, United States",Cloudtools developed the industry's first drag and drop solution that allows you move any virtualized machine from anywhere to anywhere.,"576,081",,,,,,,,,,,,,Southern US,Active,2014-08-01,day,3,11-50,"Kelly Jones, Ph.D., Mike LaPeters, Sam Cece",2,,,,

Initially focusing on preventing access to un-secured alcoholic beverages and to help local convenience stores reduce loss due to theft. While increasing convenience, future revenues and safety of the retailers and their customers. Traken has engineered and developed the HopsLock™ ID Verification System for use by retailers of beer. The HopsLock™ device serves as a deterrent to would be beer thieves by leveraging the responsibility of access to the beer coolers to the customers of the retail stores and taking the burden off employees and managers.  After querying several local convenience store locations in a major chain throughout the valley we have discovered that beer theft, on average accounts for approximately $7,000 per quarter and some locations have reported upwards of $30,000 in theft per quarter.  By combining our current system with the MOBICLOUD and utilizing the IP's algorithm we will be able to store/retrieve the data from each swipe of an ID. This information can then be SECURELY and wirelessly transmitted and retrieved anywhere from the secure cloud. This data will be used in several ways to include: Prosecution of crimes committed against retailers, data collection and analysis of market, specific target advertisement based on collected data. The aforementioned features will initially create an immediate deterrent to those who commit beer theft crimes against retailers.The evolution of the IP will allow future products to be accessed remotely and securely which will give us a unique ability to safely retrieve customer's data without the risk of identity theft. The secure wireless abilities allow us to cut costs during installation by eliminating the dependence of wired devices and onsite hard drives. By lowering our cost we directly lower our customers cost and are capable of delivering a superior product at appropriate prices.","Cloud Computing, Information Technology, Security",http://www.trackentech.com,"Scottsdale, Arizona, United States",Mobile Cloud Access Control Security,"1,019,808",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Greater Phoenix Area, Western US",Closed,2013-01-01,year,3,1-10,"Joshua J.

What are the Key Platform Features? - One cloud solution with multiple site-building options. - Ability to launch, clone, move, share and test sites in seconds with the Snapshot feature. - 7-day rolling automatic backups for both development and live sites, with access to restores from the dashboard 24/7. - Collaboration with clients and other users by connecting accounts to manage and share cloud sites and development activities. - Intuitive dashboard that reduces complexity to a handful of clicks and is easy to use for all technical levels. - Highly secure, blazingly quick clouds on high-spec infrastructure with hosting options in multiple global datacenters (North America and Europe available at launch). - Software-specific support and knowledge available through SiphonLabs ""Cloud Coaches"" (support team). - Value-added services such as domain purchasing, email mailbox purchasing and setup, and SSL certificate purchasing and management, will be introduced later this year.","Blogging Platforms, Cloud Computing, Web Hosting",http://siphonlabs.com,"Dallas, Texas, United States",Premium Managed WordPress Hosting,"1,641,586",,,,,,,,,,,,,"Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, Southern US",Active,2013-03-01,day,3,1-10,"James Bohan-Pitt, Kevin Marvin, Shaun McCormick",,,,,

Mobility is expected. Securing this connectivity is the point! This is why we developed “Fluid security” — eM-Connect™. The entire eM-Connect™ ecosystem was designed and developed with you in mind. “User Experience” really matters! End users want what they know and know what they want. Sysadmins face layers upon layers of complex systems and tasks. Service provider margins are tight, complexity is really expensive. Developers need a flexible, secure connectivity “snap in” to simplify development. We've made secure connectivity accessible and simple, by focusing on the entire ecosystem’s User Experience. The eM-Connect™ platform addresses modern “Web Scale” systematic approaches to provide scalable, distributed, secure, and reliable connectivity services. To be clear “Web Scale” is not an acronym for “Big” It’s about dynamics, like: what to scale, when to scale and where to scale, based on: users, content, location, network stability and hardware status. Our “fluid security” methods let eM-Connect™ scale from SME to Google levels because of design. Our new system of flexible secure connectivity solutions provides, at runtime, encapsulation of existing internet and network transport protocols, allowing existing applications, resources and services to benefit from our secure connectivity methods without needing to redevelop these programs.

Texan Hosting,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/texan-hosting,"Texan Hosting is a web hosting company based in Houston Texas. We offer web hosting and cloud hosting to businesses and consumers on our private server network. We primarily target the market of currently purchasing or recently purchased direct mail advertising companies and individuals, who will want to have excellent web hosting and a nice website for their future customers and patrons. We also offer our graphic arts and web designing services to small businesses and consumers who are looking for a custom touch to their newly created or renovated websites. This is a lucrative business. We offer excellent customer support to our customers. We offer 24 hour customer support and guaranteed 99.9% uptime on their websites. We also off very fast propagation times for our customers transferring websites, which can be a notoriously slow process with some of the bigger more well established hosting websites. We offer a fully functional website where customers and businesses can visit and purchase goods and services, such as hosting, email hosting, and website design and logo creation.  The company is run and was founded by general manager Blake Harp. He brings with him a background in hosting for one of the largest web hosting firms in the nation, hostgator.com. He also brings with him much personal experience. Some of our creative work is done in house, and some is outsourced.  Texan Hosting's mission is to partner with direct mail advertising companies and let them offer their products and services under their own name or if they would like they can have a manger account, which is offered under the companies name, as well. This is a great offer for some smaller direct mail advertising companies as they do not have the ability to fully dive into their own web hosting business. This will also give these companies the appearance of being a much larger company than they might actually be, and will overall be a great compliment to their current services for their custom.","Cloud Computing, Consumer, Web Hosting",,"Houston, Texas, United States",Texan Hosting is a web hosting company based in Houston Texas.
