Birth of a child is perhaps one of life's most treasured moment, for every parent! Protecting the child's health and ensuring proper nutrition and growth is the single most important goal of all parents. One of the most important ways of protecting the child's future is timely vaccination and every single parent tries hard to get their child vaccinated.  Apart from getting the child fully immunized, it is also imperative to monitor the growth of the child from time to time. Most of the vaccination records in India lack the growth charts being updated each time visit is made to the hospital. iCHR enables the following advantages: * Automatic vaccination schedule and growth charts on your fingertips. * Automatic vaccination reminders and notifications on parents mobile phone. * No confusion or fear of losing child's health data, even if parents do not bring their mobile phone during doctors visit. * Fully secured vaccination records * Automatic calculation of next vaccine date if previous vaccine has been delayed, thereby ensuring that there is optimal time interval between two doses of the vaccine * Since they are electronic records they will be validated for school admissions/visa purposes, and saves parent/doctors time in issuing vaccination certificates * Parents can sit at home and track their child’s growth using the interactive growth charts, on their mobile phone. * Long term vaccination surveillance. * Long term growth surveillance.
