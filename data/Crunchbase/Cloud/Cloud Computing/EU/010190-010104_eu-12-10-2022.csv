Evolutionary Engineering AG,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/evolutionary-engineering,"EVEN - Evolutionary Engineering AG was founded in 2004 as an incorporated company by Oliver König, Marc Wintermantel and Nino Zehnder just finished with their PhD theses in the field of Structural Optimization at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. Currently EVEN employs around 10 people for engineering services and software development. From the research work of the three founders at the Centre of Structure Technologies, a new generation of optimization methods and tools based on Evolutionary Algorithms emerged, which allow to virtually optimize any problem that can be simulated by computers in a reasonable way. During recent years, these methods have already proven their superior efficiency in many applications, e.g. in Formula 1 racing, MotoGP racing, America's Cup sailing, or on aerospace parts. Out of this experience EVEN developed the optimization platform OpLyX. Through the close collaboration with different Formula 1 teams EVEN started developing concepts for efficient Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) algorithms. Out of this the FSI-software CoLyX emerged with the unique possibility to handle the mesh-morphing of huge CFD-models as they are used today in many areas. As the most recent software development ComPoLyX joined the family of EVEN's software portfolio. ComPoLyX provides advanced composite failure analysis including some unique algorithms that allow to calculate interlaminar shear and normal stresses out of standard layered-shell FEM-models.","Cloud Computing, Software, Software Engineering",http://www.even-ag.ch,"Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland",Evolutionary Engineering is a provider of composite analysis and optimization technology relying on cloud computing.,"774,143",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Closed,2004-01-01,year,3,11-50,"Marc Wintermantel, Nino Zehnder, Oliver Konig",,,,,

Nessos - MBrace the cloud,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nessos-m-brace-the-cloud,"{m}brace is a big data framework for private and public clouds.  {m}brace is similar to Hadoop in functionality but its main difference is that it is not confined to the map-reduce programming paradigm. It is taking care of all things that have to do with task orchestration and data flow between computer nodes, allowing the user to deal just with the algorithm that he wants to execute. Moreover, it abstracts the underlying cloud infrastructure which means that any code developed using {m}brace can either run on a private or a public cloud that is supported. {m}brace is also providing the mbrace shell where someone can delve into REPL style programming which enables fast code prototyping in a cloud scale. Moreover it enables you to monitor your computer nodes, deploy new code and get information about the jobs that are currently executing. {m}brace also offers superior performance compared to the competition, providing upto 2x faster running times compared with Hadoop in various big data benchmarking algorithms. Use {m}brace to: - Harness the computational power of contemporary compute farms  - Boost productivity by giving the developer a simple, streamlined programming experience - Facilitate the utilization of legacy code to distributed parallel environments - Gain maximum performance from your computer nodes {m}brace is the flagship of Nessos, a highly qualified software development company, based mostly on Microsoft .NET with C# and F# as languages of choice.
