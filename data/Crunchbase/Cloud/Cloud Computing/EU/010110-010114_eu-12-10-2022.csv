Integromat,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/integromat-2,"Integromat is an integration and automation service offering unique features. Here is a short overview: * Automations can be very complex. You can automate an unlimited number of consecutive actions, not just 1:1 (if this:then that). Each action has at its disposal data returned by previous actions. This allows you to automate your entire workflow, not just one part. * Integromat gives you the possibility to use built-in routers to duplicate any incoming data. Using routers, you can divide your scenario into multiple routes and process data separately in each route. More information can be found here: http://intm.at/b/4  * Integromat supports dynamically created inputs and outputs. Thanks to this feature you can, for example, call remote database procedures and map their input and output variables. It’s a function that you won't find anywhere else. * Built-in feeders are special modules that can split incoming data into multiple parts and then process each part separately. For example, if you receive an email with multiple attachments, you can handle each attachment separately. * Aggregators, on the other hand, allow to merge individual data into a single bundle. We can, for example, create a ZIP archive of files contained in a specific folder and then save it or send it anywhere. More information on feeders and aggregators can be found here: http://intm.at/b/3  * We can work with files as if they were binary data. Therefore we do not need to know the path to a folder. This lets you, for example, transform images or work with file content as with a text. * Another unique feature is the possibility to schedule webhooks. With Integromat you can, for example, make an automation that will gather text messages received on your mobile phone during a day and then at midnight select a winner. Standard webhooks are of course also supported. * We support serialization and deserialization of JSON documents and give you the possibility to work with your data in any way. Nested objects or fields are no problem for us. * Thanks to the transaction processing of data, Integromat is able to complete an entire automation as scheduled. In case of error, Integromat reverts all changes and restores the initial state. In short, it will either perform all actions as scheduled or nothing. * Integromat stores incomplete runs (DLQ). If an automation encounters an error, we will save its state. This ensures that no data are lost. You can then fix the issue and continue executing from where it was stopped. * Perfect visualization of everything you do. From possibility to watch how your automation is being executed to visualization of data flow in the Execution history. Currently, we support 110 services (https://www.integromat.com/en/integrations) and thanks to the integrated support for the most widely used databases (MySQL, MS SQL, PostgreSQL) Integromat offers almost unlimited possibilities for automation. We continuously expand our list of supported services.","Cloud Computing, Cloud Data Services, Data Integration, SaaS, Software",https://www.integromat.com,"Prague, Hlavni mesto Praha, Czech Republic",Integromat is a software developer of workflow automation applications.,"95,015","6,064,770","2,367,551.5",547.85%,-48.03%,461,6.82,29.36%,29.13%,-24.47%,"26,580","-84,821",-76.14%,European Union (EU),Active,2012-01-01,year,6,11-50,"Michal Toman, Ondřej Gazda, Patrik Šimek, Pavel Duras, Roman Bršlica, Tomáš Schel",2,36,,,

Ciiva,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ciiva,"Ciiva is an electronic component management solutions company with two core products: Cloud based collaborative bill of materials management software (“Ciiva Client”) Online electronic component search engine (“Ciiva Online Search”) The Online Search provides instant access to information including real time pricing and availability, second sources, lifecycle status, alternatives and substitutes, pricing and inventory history for tens of millions of components. Documentation including datasheets and application notes can be accessed with single click, with direct links to supplier websites. The Ciiva Client is a real time collaborative software application designed specifically for organising and managing electronic component and bill of materials data. It enables multiple users to work in parallel and supports advanced features including version control. It is fully integrated with the Ciiva Online Search, seamlessly bringing together the component library and bill of materials with all other related information sources. Why do I need it? If you have ever asked one of the following questions, then Ciiva can help.  What is the current lifecycle status of a component used on my product? Which products is a particular component deployed on? Which supplier has a particular component in stock and is the cheapest? Is there a second source available for a specific component? What is the difference between two bill of materials? What is the historical pricing and availability of a component? Who changed that, when did they change it, and what did they change? Having instant access to information such as lifecycle status, potential alternatives, real-time and historical pricing and availability, “where used”, and “who, when and what changed” can help design engineers and procurement personnel make better decisions throughout the product lifecycle, from initial component selection in a design, to understanding the impact of an obsolescence notification. Ciiva is a single source for all of this information and more, saving you hours of time scouring multiple sources, trying to find reliable information you need to make important decisions. Many of today’s electronic devices contain a large number of components, from a variety of different manufacturers and suppliers. Changes to a BOM can happen at various stages throughout the lifecycle of a product, often without changing original hardware design data, such as schematics or layout. For many companies, this can involve an error prone manual change to a spreadsheet or document, with no record of who made the changes, when they were made or why they were made. Ciiva provides a fully traceable, version controlled BOM management feature, where every component used in a BOM is linked to an access controlled, centralized component library.","Cloud Computing, Enterprise Software, Manufacturing, Software, Vertical Search",https://ciiva.com,"Horw, Luzern, Switzerland",Ciiva develops and offers cloud based bill of materials and electronic parts management software.,"471,963","19,355","12,775.33",33.64%,-73.53%,99,1.75,22.98%,43.38%,-47.68%,"1,546,311","-222,623",-12.59%,,Active,2012-05-01,month,2,11-50,"Fei Wang, Ronald Vuillemin",,,,,

"MINE, Inc. and MINE Innovation Engineering GmbH",https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mine-inc-and-mine-innovation-engineering-gmbh,"MINE and Reality Ventures provide a unique vertically integrated corporate ecosystem for the creation of technology companies. It offers strategic and financial investors cost-effective, lower risk technology innovation with higher ROI. A  five-stage targeted innovation engineering and technology company creation process called IP Mining:tm: covers the entire path from the original invention at the core of a new technology to the successful establishment of a company for bringing the corresponding products to market. The MINE group of companies, consisting of MINE Holding GmbH, MINE Innovation Engineering GmbH and its subsidiary MINE Inc. in San Francisco, and Reality Ventures Beteiligungs GmbH were founded and established in Berlin in June/July 2013 by the innovator and entrepreneur Rolf Herken together with the company Dassault Systèmes International S.A.S. as founding partner and first strategic investor. MINE and Reality Ventures provide a unique vertically integrated corporate ecosystem for the creation of technology companies. Headquartered in Berlin with main research and development centers in San Francisco and Berlin, the two companies are bringing some of the world’s brightest minds together to develop completely new, high impact technologies with extremely low overhead in the shortest possible time. They design, build and develop platforms and solutions that operate on a massive scale to benefit millions of people. MINE and Reality Ventures also provide the corporate and financial framework for the successful implementation of a new, highly efficient funding model for start-ups that benefits both innovators and investors. While scientists and engineers will be freed up to put their talent to work on innovative solutions without distraction, it is expected that in return for the funding of this ecosystem, significant strategic advantages and exceptionally large returns will be generated for the strategic and financial investors in Reality Ventures. How it works: Most ideas in technology do not materialize out of the blue. They are the result of intellectual and technological processes that happen over long periods of time. They can be localized and   discovered based on knowledge of these processes and subsequently be mined efficiently. It is not efficient to stumble around and pick up gold nuggets by chance. Unlike traditional early stage venture capital fund-based approaches which invest in multitudes of start-up companies with minor variations of relatively simple but unproven ideas, the targeted innovation generation at MINE aims at creating start-up companies with relevant products that are biased toward high growth and a lower investment risk. MINE provides a unique opportunity for brilliant innovators and highly talented, experienced engineers to develop and pursue a product idea that excites them in a largely pressure-free environment, with competitive pay and benefits plus the guarantee that they will own a significant share of their start-up.  Once their idea is proven feasible, it can be commercialized without having to spend their own funds, precious time or emotional capital hunting for financial backers. Reality Ventures funds MINE, which in turn provides intellectual, corporate, financial and legal support for the engineering project teams. To maximize success rates, MINE and Reality Ventures have devised a five-stage IP Mining:tm: process: Innovation, Ingeneering:tm:, Incubating, Investing and Implementing. Ingeneering:tm: is the targeted creation of proof-of-concept and prototype technologies by MINE’s ingenious engineering talent. It is the key stage of the IP Mining:tm: process. Once each proof-of-concept technology is validated, typically within 18 to 24 months, a start-up company is formed with the option for the engineers to join and own a significant share of their start-up company at low personal risk. The MINE group of companies operates in the form of transcontinental teams led by accomplished innovation and business executives who guide the project teams, guarantee a smooth business operation, and ensure the timely creation of the resulting start-up companies initially funded by Reality Ventures. The model leverages the experience and insight of the strategic investors into innovation and engineering for a vast range of industries and customers to advise MINE and help the company to select its innovation engineering projects wisely. It also leverages effectively the cash reserves of these investors for targeted innovation engineering projects and the funding of the resulting technology companies without increasing their operating expenses and hence without decreasing their earnings per share. At the same time, it allows the strategic investors to share the associated risk with a group of large financial investors while having a first right of refusal on the resulting companies. In return, these financial investors will greatly benefit from the higher likelihood of success resulting from the new model. Targeted Industries and Domains:  MINE innovation engineering projects are initially focused on the development of fundamental scalable platform solutions for cloud computing -	Data and process distribution -	Secure communication and transaction processing -	Image processing -	Data analytics -	Visualization -	Simulation -	Artificial intelligence and on related cloud-based consumer and professional applications. Innovation engineering projects may also be focused on -	Application-specific processor logic design -	Neural computing -	Robotics -	Energy -	Life Sciences and Medical Technologies. Some of the technological challenges that could be tackled in MINE Innovation Engineering projects are -	cloud-based professional environments for product creation and delivery -	cloud-based digital transaction technologies and platforms -	cloud-based technologies and platforms for security and privacy -	cloud-based intelligent support systems -	cloud-based future-generation telecommunication technologies and platforms. With sufficient funding, MINE could also tackle these problems -	revolutionary (computer) processor architectures and manufacturing processes -	scalable technologies for cost-efficient, sustainable energy creation   Current Status: Dassault Systèmes International S.A.S. is the first strategic investor in Reality Ventures. The initial investment of Reality Ventures in MINE funds the targeted creation of several large- scale, confidential proof-of-concept prototypes. Once validated internally, these projects will be turned into valuable start-up businesses funded by Reality Ventures. MINE’s current core team of ten seasoned executives and widely respected engineers includes -	Rolf Herken, CEO and CTO, MINE -	Peter Mehlstaeubler, COO and Managing Director of MINE, Berlin -	Larry Tesler , MINE Chief Experience Officer -	Rebecca Tredway, COO MINE of San Francisco -	Karen Kuehnert, CFO of MINE -	Gary Yost, VP Engineering Management of MINE, San Francisco In addition, MINE will hire more than twenty scientists and engineers within the next six months. MINE foresees the creation of additional subsidiaries in other locations with a high density of engineering talent.

StormMQ is sold as a monthly subscription. As a true next generation messaging system, StormMQ embraces the emerging AMQP standard and has extensive development library support for a host of environments including Java, .NET and PHP on Linux, Windows, Solaris and Mac OS X. The StormMQ platform is designed from the ground up to scale. The platform is delivered in two formats, as a cloud based service for low volume users, and either a co-located or hosted service for organisations with stringent operational requirements. Based on a flexible yet power framework, StormMQ is able to quickly scale to meet the needs of a wide variety of architectures and application requirements. The system has been tested thoroughly with leading third party applications such as VMWare's RabbitMQ, RedHat MRG, and Apache QPid with support for Python and Ruby under development. The platform offers message sizes from 1 byte up to 50Mb to satisfy even the most demanding of applications. As a cloud based service, StormMQ requires no capital expenditure on hardware or infrastructure and removes the ongoing cost and complexity of managing on-site message queuing servers and applications. To ensure absolute security for sensitive data traffic, StormMQ is the first cloud based messaging platform to utilise 256-bit IPSEC VPN as well as disk level encryption using non-proprietary cryptographic algorithms as standard. Security is further enhanced by StormMQ's Locate-Itâ„¢ Option for users to own all encrypted disks at the start of a contract to be certain of their disposal. This provides certificates on the location and ownership of hardware throughout any contract. Alongside our flagship StormMQ platform, we also offer a complete portfolio of value added services including consultancy, technical support and training to help our clients design, operate and support advanced message queuing environments.

Libramatic.com,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/libramatic-com,"Libramatic provides a fully automated smartphone and web-based library system. Managing a library or CD collection is a tedious task. Adding books to the system, for example, requires that all a books information is manually typed in by the librarian. Libramatic solves this, as well as many of a librarian's other day-to-day problems. With Libramatic, the only thing a librarian has to do is scan the ISBN code on the back of a book and Libramatic will search the web to find that books information. The book's full information is then stored in a database in the cloud. When the book is being loaned out the librarian simply has to scan the ISBN and the user's library card using any smartphones camera. This is very time saving and reduces the amount of effort needed drastically. Libramatic has an intuitive, easy to use web interface which allows library management and statistics to be accessed on a computer or other device. It offers the complete range of library/collection management functions including, for example, an automated reminder system for overdue books and a book reservation service allied with a comprehensive Lending Statistics and Utilisation suite.

BlackBox-BI,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blackbox-bi,"The BlackBox-BI mission statement is; to provide easy to use affordable Business Intelligence for companies of all sizes. Easier said than done of course and we are not the only ones that want to do this. So how are we going to bring Business Intelligence to the masses? By focusing on the 4 key factors that in our eyes enable successful BI for companies. Affordability When the Business Intelligence solution is affordable it can be used by more members of your company thus giving more people access to critical information and allowing them to take better decisions. A lower cost of ownership further allows you to develop a more advanced business intelligence solution. When launching a BI project companies often spend a considerable chunk of their budget on configuring servers and software. This can easily take up to a few weeks of development and tuning. All this money could have been better spent on building reports, dashboards and analytics models that will be of benefit to your users. Once a BI solution is up and running it will need to be maintained. This requires dedicated resources that often are not available. Ownership of BI solutions is a major problem for a lot of companies. Usually it is the role of the IT department because it touches a lot of technical subjects but functionally it is usually a bit of a grey area. We have taken care of the technical part of the solution and if you want we can do the functional side as well. Ease of use We believe Business Intelligence needs to be accessible to members in all levels of your organization. Decisions are made every day by executives as well as production staff. By using our easy to use platform these decisions will be founded on solid information instead of hunches and assumptions. Performance Time is money, the old adagium is more valid than ever. That is why we believe a Business Intelligence platform needs to give answers to business questions quickly. We achieve exceptional performance by using hardware that is especially selected for the task at hand and software that has been designed from the ground up for analytical and reporting workloads. Scalability Every business wants to grow and we believe your BI platform needs to be able easily to grow with you. BI becomes a limiting factor. With BlackBox-BI we grow along with you. You can start out small with only a handful of users and gradually add users, data and functionality. This is hard to do with traditional BI solutions as they usually get dimensioned for a certain number of users and will need to be upgraded as the number of users grows. BlackBox-BI aims would like to do things different, easier faster and cheaper.  OK enough with the marketing talk. We will use these pages to explain ho we think BI can be beneficial to your company and how BlackBox-BI will help you become better decision makers. Please feel free to browse around our site and do drop us a line if you have any questions regarding our products and services.","Analytics, Business Intelligence, Cloud Computing, Software",http://www.blackbox-bi.com,"Paris, Ile-de-France, France",Cloud Business Intelligence,"2,084,416",,,,,,,,,,,,,European Union (EU),Closed,2010-07-01,day,,1-10,,,,,,
