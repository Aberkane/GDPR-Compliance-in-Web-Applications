Charity Engine,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/the-charity-engine,"[Charity Engine®](http://www.charityengine.com/) is a PC app which creates the world's cheapest, greenest - and most ethical - computing platform. Watch the advert [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RgbDtUqnrA). **The Concept** Based on the proven idea of [volunteer computing](http://www.gridcafe.org/volunteer-computing-.html), Charity Engine harnesses the vast, wasted capacity of the world's home and office PCs - a technically simple feat, but one which requires the permission of the world's PC owners first. The Charity Engine app gains that permission by converting the donated computing into real money for top international charities - and also, every so often, a substantial cash prize for one lucky volunteer. Profits are shared equally between Charity Engine, the users and the charities. (Companies can also choose to share the profits from their PCs instead of being in the prize draws.) The Charity Engine grid currently has over 100,000 PCs in over 160 countries, and is as powerful as a top 5 supercomputer. As Charity Engine has the public support of their [international charity partners](http://www.charityengine.com/charities) (and others pending), it should easily become the world's most popular volunteer grid - in effect, the first worldwide computer - capable of utterly transforming scientific research and industrial productivity. (Just 0.5% of the Internet is more powerful than every supercomputer on Earth combined. It is truly in a class of its own.) **Making It Happen** Charity Engine is based on Berkeley University's [BOINC](http://boinc.berkeley.edu/), the de facto industry standard software for volunteer computing. BOINC is mature, reliable and supports dozens of applications including AutoDock and Blender. It has been used by millions of home PCs for nearly ten years without any security issues. It is also 100% open-source. The director of BOINC, Prof David Anderson, was their full-time technical consultant for six months. Matt Blumberg and his expert team ([GridRepublic](http://www.gridrepublic.org/), [Progress Thru Processors](https://www.facebook.com/progressthruprocessors)) designed and coded the site, which launched as a private beta on 31 July 2011, as announced on stage at [TNW 2011](http://thenextweb.com/eu/2011/04/29/charity-engine-could-achieve-exascale-computing-by-2012/). Now live. **Making It Valuable** Obviously, the business must have a revenue stream to generate the charity donations and prize fund. This comes from science and industry renting processing time on the 'global grid' for an incredibly cheap rate; just 0.3 cents per average CPU core/hour or 2c-4c per GPU/hr.  As it normally costs more than 1c/hr just to power a CPU core, Charity Engine can effectively provide cloud computing for 'below cost' yet still make money. It is the world's cheapest computing platform by an order of magnitude. Other valuable uses include ultra-secure storage, distributed web-indexing, web diagnostics, penetration testing, cryptography, the Charity Engine-branded distributed CDN and sponsorship. By monetizing the model, Charity Engine completely solves the one problem that prevents most researchers from using volunteer computing: the risk of not finding enough volunteers. Not every project can capture the public's imagination, and scientists have better things to do than create advertising campaigns. For the first time, the surplus computing resources of the Internet can be bought and paid for, by anyone. It is the ultimate supercomputer for hire. **The Unexpected Bonus** Not only is Charity Engine the cheapest and potentially most powerful computing platform in the world, it is also the most environmentally friendly.  For a start, it requires no new hardware. That's half the energy costs of any new system. Nor does it require vast new billion-dollar facilities to house it, staffed and air-conditioned. In fact, it needs virtually no net cooling at all.  Unlike datacentres and supercomputers, they don't stress the components (their volunteer's PCs). A typical laptop CPU can cruise at 60% activity for just another 4-10Watts compared to idling, so that is their default setting.  No excessive heat, no noisy fans, no surprise bills - and the grid effectively gains ~60% of a full-power CPU for less energy than charging a smartphone. This is the key to Charity Engine's incredible efficiency: using machines which already exist and are already switched on.  GPUs do use more power to run Charity Engine (+30W, on average), but they are actually even more efficient than CPUs. They can then reduce carbon costs even further by using a technique they're calling the 'Winternet' - something that only a global grid can do. Supercomputers and data-centres have one problem they cannot escape: megawatts of heat. Fortunately for us, it's always cold somewhere - and everywhere is cooler at night. Charity Engine will therefore keep shifting data to the globe's coldest PCs, where the extra heat is actually a welcome bonus and not just wasted on air conditioning. It really can be the greenest supercomputer on the planet. Especially now that their Android app is nearly finished... **Leave No Science Behind** There will always be worthy projects with huge computing needs but no money (just like most existing BOINC networks), so 5%-10% of the Charity Engine grid will be permanently reserved for ""pure, poor science"" and overseen by an independent advisory board. The first three members of the board are Prof David Anderson, Prof Stephen Wolfram and Dr Ethan Siegel, noted experts in computing, mathematics and astrophysics respectively. Fundamental physics, molecular biology, materials science, genetics and other key areas will also be well-represented. Finally, Charity Engine has given all their charity partners the power of veto regarding who they do business with. No unethical research will ever be allowed to use the worldwide computer.

Leveraging distributed storage technologies, Amplidata enables customers to build highly available storage infrastructures at significantly reduced cost. The company is addressing some of the inherent weaknesses of high capacity disk systems, such as performance, bit error rates, mean time between failures and RAID rebuild times which have not improved sufficiently to keep up with the explosion of digital storage needs. Amplidata was in founded in 2008 by Wim De Wispelaere (CEO) and Wouter Van Eetvelde (COO), two storage veterans. They have been involved in the development and launch of several innovative products and technologies. Serial entrepreneur and high-tech visionary Kristof De Spiegeleer is the primary investor. The trio De Spiegeleer, De Wispelaere and Van Eetvelde was previously successful with DataCenter Technologies (acquired by Symantec) and Dedigate (acquired by Terremark). De Spiegeleer also added Q-Layer (acquired by SUN Microsystems) to his track record. Amplidata has its operational headquarters at the Innovation Center in IT Valley in Lochristi, near Gent, Belgium.

Texxi Global,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/texxi,"Increasing urbanisation is posing significant problems to many of the worlds cities, especially the very largest megacities whose infrastructure cannot cope with the demand for transport by millions of users daily. A Transit Exchange is a means to rationalise contended access to any “transportspace” (roadspace, waterway or airspace system) based on the construct of a commodity futures exchange. Most simply it enables real-time, dynamic ridesharing on a very large scale in any type of vehicle which carries passengers or freight. Using mathematical optimisation techniques (based on heuristics and genetic algorithms) the Transit Exchange examines and aggregates origin-destination requests for transport from dispersed users in both space and time (who may or may not know one another) and applies operational concepts and knowhow garnered from successful prior deployments, Texxi provides a relevant trip package suggestions for ridesharing to those users and the vehicle operators in the locality. The Transit Exchange also generates income for municipal road operators from the very market making functions used to fill the empty seats in the fleet or vehicles operated in the “transportspace”. Now congestion pricing, road pricing and vehicle pricing charges can all be applied to users and a negative congestion charge implemented so as to not adversely affect the poorest in society. Predictive Analytics permit the transport users to choose when to travel and the transport service providers to place their assets in the most logical positions to best serve demand. If an investor was to deploy an amount of money into the Transit Exchange, then through the market making protocols in solving NP-hard problems related to Large Scale Dynamic Real-time Ridesharing a set of returns with varying yield-to-maturities can be replicated, providing an alternative to money-market funds and instantiated through the mechanism of a blockchain coin offering. Rather than relying on the rather nebulous promise of perpetual cryptographic security of a blockchain ledger, the provable work done has solved a pressing and current problem in the real world and done so in a manner that was transparent. High Liquidity investable security instruments (Transit Exchange Bill or TE-Bills) can thus be made available via the Transit Exchange. Its original purpose. To store value represented by demand for travel in a locality. Hence we will have a computational-crypto-currency backed by a commodity called “transport demand”. From 1968 - 2010, many academics in many of the top Universities in the world said that dynamic, real-time, ridesharing was not yet possible. Texxi proved it was possible in 2006 and in 2008, using the idea of a futures exchange, a dynamic social network map and genetic algorithms to solve an otherwise intractable solution.

Currently EVEN employs around 10 people for engineering services and software development. From the research work of the three founders at the Centre of Structure Technologies, a new generation of optimization methods and tools based on Evolutionary Algorithms emerged, which allow to virtually optimize any problem that can be simulated by computers in a reasonable way. During recent years, these methods have already proven their superior efficiency in many applications, e.g. in Formula 1 racing, MotoGP racing, America's Cup sailing, or on aerospace parts. Out of this experience EVEN developed the optimization platform OpLyX. Through the close collaboration with different Formula 1 teams EVEN started developing concepts for efficient Fluid-Structure-Interaction (FSI) algorithms. Out of this the FSI-software CoLyX emerged with the unique possibility to handle the mesh-morphing of huge CFD-models as they are used today in many areas. As the most recent software development ComPoLyX joined the family of EVEN's software portfolio. ComPoLyX provides advanced composite failure analysis including some unique algorithms that allow to calculate interlaminar shear and normal stresses out of standard layered-shell FEM-models.","Cloud Computing, Software, Software Engineering",http://www.even-ag.ch,"Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland",Evolutionary Engineering is a provider of composite analysis and optimization technology relying on cloud computing.,"774,143",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Closed,2004-01-01,year,3,11-50,"Marc Wintermantel, Nino Zehnder, Oliver Konig",,,,,

The latest version of a document is always available and users can revert to previous versions if they wish to do so.

Content cannot even be emailed to anyone else and, if a user wants to provide anyone else with visibility of their documents, a link is provided which gives a file location where it can be viewed. Included as standard is a detailed auditing trail which helps control the use of potentially sensitive information and has also been designed with one eye on the future and compliance with more stringent regulatory controls that are on the horizon.

It has been developed using peer to peer (p2p) technologies with an easy to use and pleasing to look at interface.
