Telos.ai	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/telos-ai	2018-01-01	year	1-10	Telos.ai is a Silicon Valley technology company with British roots. It uses AI and gaming technologies to build new kinds of cognitive collaborative solutions in the cloud. Their flagship product is the TelOS platform. Telos.ai is motivated by problems that involve a high degree of human creativity and typically involve aesthetic or abstract thinking. Examples include how to visualize abstract concepts like “cashflow” (e.g. see Cogni-Draw Rendering Engine). Their goal is to use cognitive computing to build solutions that amplify human creativity and productivity within the enterprise. They call this augmented creativity.  They do this by building the “conceptual thinking” of users into their platform. In other words, when someone makes a document, say a Powerpoint, its content extends beyond the page to a set of ideas encoded in the “mental models” of the workers. TelOS attempts to encode its own “mental model” of any content created on the platform.	https://telos.ai/	Artificial Intelligence, Collaboration, Enterprise Software	Berkeley, California, United States	Telos.AI is a next-generation visual collaboration tool.	719,570

Video Brewer	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/video-brewer	2017-07-05	day	1-10	Video Brewer is a way for businesses to create awesome videos, crowdsourced from their communities of users automatically. The online collaborative service that, as a first step, lets businesses share a link, or QR code, with their users, with a call to share videos from their smartphones. The software then guides those users through video filming and lets them upload their clip. Then comes the hard part (technologically speaking), in which VideoBrewer automatically edits the best clips into a single, smooth montage, ready to be published and (re)shared. The collaboration framework is a web application, with a desktop & mobile interface for project owners (the businesses) and a mobile-web interface for users to film & upload.  In the project owner interface, the user can create new projects, then review all the footage submitted, select or delete clips, and choose a theme for the automatic montage. The more advanced part of the software uses machine learning tools to analyse color & audio in the videoclips, as well as recognise faces, and then uses the themes that we have created to stitch together clips for maximum smoothness.  Video Brewer is must-have tool for event organizers, venues, social media influencers, digital agencies, local businesses… and everybody who has a community!  	https://www.videobrewer.com	B2B, Collaboration, Social, Video	Xylophagou, Larnaca, Cyprus	automatically create authentic crowdsourced videos with your community	1,916,704

Peoplegogo	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/peoplegogo	2017-06-08	day	1-10	Peoplegogo lets you start your own social campaign to bring the right people together to contribute their skills and expertise, because by working together we can make a positive impact on society and improve the life of people around us. I will give you a few examples.  Imagine a charity event in our city which needs the support of the locals. These locals  may want to contribute own time for the preparation and running of the event.  Imagine a storm or a flood which destroys the house of our neighbours. In an awful situation like this, they will desperately need help. Initially they will need shelter, food and clothing and then attention will turn to rebuilding their houses - all of this combined will help. Or imagine the ecosystem of the nearest mountain where hundreds of trees have been cut. The ecosystem which needs its own trees back to maintain the balance of the species living there. How about getting together people who have spades, trucks and all the necessary equipment to transport a few trees to the mountain and plant them? Well, it won’t be much but it’s a good start in helping nature sustain the effects of the human intervention and to keep the Earth a good and a sustainable place for our children. So, the purpose of Peoplegogo is to connect people through the Internet and in bringing them together, to give them the tools to cooperate. There might be many different approaches but personally I recognise two important tools - ideas and activities. The ideas are simply ideas we have in mind published and visible by anyone who visits Peoplegogo. That’s the place where you announce to the world what you want to do. Anyone who is interested in your idea can follow it and open a discussion. The reason you publish your idea is that if you keep it to yourself, no one will know about it and most probably you will never see it actually become something bigger. Publish your idea, say to the world what you want to do and you may be surprised that there are people around you who want the same thing. And the next important thing is the activities. They are real projects which we are confident are not just ideas but that are built on solid foundations and people will support them by contributing their skills, money and time. So, just stop for a minute and think about it. What are the things around you which can be done with the support of people that will improve your life and bring a positive impact on society? Think about it. Let’s do something together. 	https://www.peoplegogo.com	Collaboration, Communities, Crowdsourcing, Funding Platform	London, England, United Kingdom	Peoplegogo lets you start your own social campaign to bring the right people together to contribute their skills, money and expertise.	2,146,311

Riven	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/riven	2017-01-01	year	11-50	Riven Accelerates Product Introduction with 3D Reality.  Quickly Diagnose and Fix Deviations from Design Intent.   Reach better decisions with your team and customers. New Product Introduction (NPI) is the most critical stage of manufacturing and it’s broken. An overwhelming majority of companies miss critical ship dates and suffer cost overruns due to NPI issues. Our experience designing and manufacturing thousands of physical products led us to deeply understand the costly mistakes, inefficiencies and frustration caused by sparse, error-prone analog 2D information and poor communication during NPI. These perpetual problems are only getting worse with shorter product windows, more geometrically complex products, higher quality expectations, engineering capacity constraints and fragile supply chains. Riven accelerates product introduction by vastly simplifying how teams develop, iterate and build physical products. Riven fixes broken workflows and enables everyone across the supply chain to work together – visually – on the same product by applying ‘rich as-made’ 3D part insights and digital models. By combining accurate digital 3D copies of real physical 3D parts with intelligent, collaborative software, we are creating a digital-first NPI workflow that improves customer responsiveness, time-to-market, part accuracy and production processes while minimizing development iterations and waste. Riven software is used today by innovative manufacturers across a variety of production methods including additive manufacturing, injection molding, casting and press & sinter. It was founded in 2017 and headquartered in Berkeley, California, United States.	https://www.riven.ai/	3D Printing, 3D Technology, Collaboration, Enterprise Software, Industrial Engineering, Manufacturing, Software	Berkeley, California, United States	Accelerate Product Introduction with 3D Reality	7,793	1,638				0	1.0		100%		5,907,888

Coaches Tribune	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coaches-tribune	2016-01-01	year	1-10	Coaches Tribune offers free coaching information for all of the most popular youth sports. Their site features world-class instruction to help youth sports coaches and parents gain insight and ideas from legendary coaches, renowned instructors, and some of the leading organizations in sports. The concept for Coaches Tribune was developed in the living room of Michele Kiernan, a successful real estate executive who is raising two sport-loving boys with her husband in northeast Ohio. She spent the evening playing in the backyard with her son, who grabbed a football and tee from the garage to practice kicking field goals. After repeated misses, her son asked what he was doing wrong. Michele is an avid football fan but never played the sport, and later in the evening began looking online for information on the correct way to kick a field goal. After 30 minutes of pouring through websites with pay walls and online videos that didn’t provide answers, she called her husband to express frustration at the lack of free, high-quality online resources in a single location. Through a collaboration with Sirocco Media, founded by longtime associate John Kueber, Michele began the process of building the framework for Coaches Tribune.	http://coachestribune.com	Collaboration, Sports	Ohio, Illinois, United States	Coaches Tribune offers free coaching information for all of the most popular youth sports.	1,267,904													https://coachestribune.com/privacy.pdf

Zettabox	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zettabox	2014-12-01	day	11-50	Zettabox was created to meet the need for cloud storage and teamwork-sharing tools for companies who need to comply with Europe’s ever stringent data protection regulation. Zettabox can be used by anyone, but it has been built for business, with dashboard controls essential for management of content within a corporation or team. And Zettabox has been designed with data protection built in to guarantee compliance with the new, upcoming EU regulation.  When the team began building Zettabox, the total amount of worldwide data saved on networks had surpassed the 1,000 Exabytes and entered a new era of sizing storage – Zettabytes (1 X 1021). Zettabox was created to help companies and individual keep control of that surging amount of content. The cloud team sharing and storage market is currently dominated by American-domiciled companies, which means the majority of users’ data is stored in the US or is stored in European data centres that are accessible by the US government (because those data centres are owned by US-domiciled companies). There is impending EU regulation requiring companies doing business in Europe to know where their data is stored and to be able to communicate that to their customers. Zettabox was launched as a European alternative to the US companies that are providing team sharing and cloud-based storage services. Zettabox provides data protection by design, to help you and your company comply with the European GDPR regulation.

Parablu	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/parablu	2014-08-06	day	11-50	Parablu is a Secure Data Management solution for enterprises - with a focus on Data Privacy. Drivers like cloud and mobility have made data more distributed than ever before, weakening the level of control enterprises traditionally have had over their data assets.  On top of that, businesses live with tough regulations where they are held accountable for data losses, and citizens can demand data erasure.  In such an environment, enterprises critically need solutions that can ensure the privacy of their data in the cloud.  Data management solutions like Backup, Content Collaboration, and File Sharing, as they have evolved into SaaS models, haven’t sufficiently addressed the enterprise's need for data privacy. Parablu has built a solution stack where Data Privacy is built-in. Using encryption along with strict enforcement of Segregation of Duties, their Privacy Gateway powered solution ensures enterprise data stays safe in the cloud.	https://www.parablu.com	Cloud Security, Collaboration, Enterprise Applications, Enterprise Software, File Sharing, Information Technology, Software	Fremont, California, United States	Parablu is a B2B SaaS company focused on providing Data Resiliency and Data Security Solutions.	41,173	6,562	11,864	-72.48%	-92.86%	10	1.34	-77.31%	90.67%	318.22%	2,907,723	1,564,783	116.52%

Competitors are designing electronic instruments for electronic musicians, their thought process is not concerned with people who aren’t. At our earliest design stages we ask how do we design tools not only for professionals but also for drawing future musicians in? How do we make something that feels inviting and inclusive? No one else seems to be asking. Electronic instruments today create barriers to creativity. Hardware is complex and unmusical, software instruments aren't inspiring, products generally lack focus. Humans crave self expression and we need the right tools to do so. After hundreds of years, instruments like guitars, violins and pianos have been perfected. Electronic instruments haven't yet.

Bindrs	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bindrs	2014-01-01	year	1-10	Bindrs offers the most productive and most pleasant way for students and educators to collaborate on multi-media notes and documents.By using social media and e-mail for private communication about projects we integrate collaboration into students' daily on-line activities, using the channels and apps they already like and use frequently. Schools and universities have problems to support students and teachers with all the different collaboration projects they expect them to do. Students need to co-create content for group assignments. Teachers need to collaborate on new courses and on other projects, but they have hardly any time together to do so. And teachers are searching for better on-line ways to support students with their assignments. They are looking for solutions that connect better with the natural on-line habitat of students.  Most available co-creation tools, like wiki's and Google Docs, are too complicated and they don't connect well with the on-line channels students and teachers like to use on a regular basis. They need to go to special websites they normally don't visit and they need to use specially created logins they keep mixing up. Email is no good solution either. It is too frustrating. Attached files get lost and versions of documents get mixed up all the time. And especially teachers are already suffering from an overload of email.  Bindrs are on-line co-working spaces that look like shared multi-media notebooks. Each contributor can connect them to his own preferred set of social media or to an e-mail address. * They keep co-creation and collaboration simple * They alert you on your favourite social networks when necessary, like no one else does * They keep it private like in a safe in Switzerland * They let you do so in style like Moleskine No installation of software or apps is needed, since we make use of the social media apps you already use. And no new logins need to be created. You can use your social media logins. Bindrs is a webapp that integrates/connects with your social media and works on all your devices. It's even possible to work together across different social media. We call this 'cross-social collaboration'. Bindrs is optimized for 'hit-and-run collaboration' to make all your time spent on a collaboration project as productive as possible. In short you could say we turned the good old school notebooks and exercise books into multi-media binders that connect to the social networks that are popular among students. They can use them to collaborate with each other and with their teachers.	https://bind.rs/	Collaboration, Education, Social Media	Bratislava, Bratislava, Slovakia (Slovak Republic)	Collaboration powered by Social Media	1,232,693

Myriada Systems	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/myriada-systems	2013-12-16	day	1-10	Myriada enables groups of experts to forecast any price, rate or indicator with extraordinary accuracy. The patent-pending technology suite is applicable to any long-short investment strategy where positions are generally held for more than an hour. Myriada achieves this versatility by harnessing an existing resource - the predictive ability of the analysts/traders within a hedge fund, trading house or prop desk. This approach improves the team’s existing, individual-centric forecasting techniques by incorporating collective intelligence. On the Myriada platform, a fund’s employees and members of their network are transformed into prediction engines - and these human predictions can also be combined with the output of computational models. By rapidly collating all estimations via weighted aggregation, Myriada generates rich, visually intelligible collective forecasts. For each, the group signal is statistically guaranteed to be more accurate than the average individual prediction, and is usually better than any individual. The power of correctly harnessed collective intelligence was empirically demonstrated with a 90-day macro multi-security trading strategy which yielded a Sharpe score of 3.66. Myriada is launching with the Financial Times on December 1st 2014.	http://myriada.co/	Analytics, Collaboration, Data Visualization, Events, Financial Services, FinTech, Innovation Management, Training	London, England, United Kingdom	Enabling professional groups to forecast future events together: delivering greater accuracy & rich visualisations of market sentiment.	574,152

Cloud Research Studio	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloud-research-studio	2012-11-05	day	11-50	We stand for a change of paradigm in data handling. Data is becoming independent from applications, but many users are still locked-down because of legacy architectures. For 4 years, we have been developing a big data platform from scratch, based on a common back-end data repository system, a common communication layer and custom apps which are environment-dependent. No longer conditioned by app switching, data management becomes simpler to design and implement, while the user maintains data ownership no matter the changing interfaces employed to access it. Our platform describes everything as entities, than models the possible interactions with other, internal or external entities, through APIs. In a logical sense, entities are the nouns and interactions are the verbs. Every entity is described by a set of properties, which act as attributes. And so, the platform adapts to business or institutional structures, not the other way around.  This technical approach sets in motion deep changes in the way we work. We are making the tools we've developed available to the whole developer community, not just within our organization. This way, companies and freelancers throughout the world can easily build custom applications and components, which are subsequently assembled into enterprise-grade solutions.	https://www.cloud.ro	Big Data, Collaboration, Developer Platform, Enterprise Software	Bucharest, Bucuresti, Romania	We are crafting an Enterprise-grade Bigdata Platform empowering the developer community to challenge the way large scale systems are built	907,036

Evocalize	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/evocalize	2012-01-01	year	11-50	Evocalize is a marketing infrastructure software company located in Seattle, Washington, with offices in Austin, Texas.  Evocalize has built the first Collaborative Marketing Platform to enable partners to execute complex marketing programs together that can't be run independently.  Evocalize is partnered deeply with Facebook and Google. ---------- Digital marketing continues to grow increasingly complex, which has paid large dividends in increased performance for large direct to consumer businesses. And, with digital advertising’s emerging privacy-first and cookie-less future taking center stage, the complexity of digital marketing will only increase.  Today, successful digital marketing programs are built upon three pillars: expertise, data, and technology. Large direct to consumer businesses often have all three key pillars, and reap the rewards. However, if a business is missing one or more of these pillars, they must enable collaborative marketing partnerships within, or outside of, their network to succeed.  Furthermore, if an organization has at least two of these pillars, typically data and expertise, they are well-positioned to create new revenue opportunities by enabling businesses in need with simple tools that grant access to performance marketing success in line with the largest direct to consumer (DTC) businesses. Collaborative marketing is an effective marketing strategy between a sponsoring partner (for example, a national marketing team, CRM providers, or marketplace) and a participating partner (for example, a local office, CRM user, non-DTC brand, or marketplace seller) that allows the execution of digital advertising programs using shared audience data, creative assets, messaging, and co-op budgets to achieve shared marketing goals. Collaborative marketing completes the three digital marketing success pillars - expertise, data and technology - for all partners involved. Evocalize's collaborative marketing platform (CMP) coordinates the execution of digital marketing programs that use shared assets, audiences, and messaging between partners to achieve results that are impossible to achieve independently.	http://evocalize.com	Advertising, Collaboration, Marketing Automation	Seattle, Washington, United States	Evocalize provides a collaborative marketing platform that enables partners to execute marketing programs together.	23,618	45,848	13,821.5	2,816.54%	33,233.33%	1,000	2.95	47.26%	46.28%	2.05%	912,290	-4,868,830	-84.22%	https://www.evocalize.com/privacy-policy

Mobbr Crowd Payments	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mobbr-crowdpayment-system	2012-01-01	year	1-10	Getting work done better, faster and cheaper. That's what every business wants and what they could easily achieve if they would make their processes more social. Think Github or Wikipedia. But most businesses still don't work like that and fail to utilize the enormous potential of crowdsourced labor. Why? A major hurdle is that 'social collaboration' requires a totally different reward system. Mobbr is a unique payment system that helps businesses to make the transition to that new, much more effective way of working and organizing. With Mobbr it takes only one click to pay out 'social salary'. Real money, but distributed based on 'social' participation in business processes. To the crowd: groups of people that contribute to a task or collaboration. Anywhere on the internet. Mobbr will radically change the way that people work and earn money. Collaboration platforms are the offices and factories of the future. And in that future a significant part of the salaries worldwide will be 'social' and run through their platform.

Beyond this, Greenocracy awards points, badges and credits for those solutions that gain the most on site political traction, mainly by rewarding the solution author/author teams, or those who helped in shaping and amending the most successful solutions. Solutions themselves are vetted through a user based voting process in which each user can cast one vote per solution.

Our approach is rooted in our belief that successful product launch is a matter of plugging in the power of all project engineering team interactions with customers representatives, R&D and lab partners, supply chain partners, manufacturing partners, marketing and distribution chain personnel and other launch-critical players involved in product development and launch.   If we can more effectively master the virtual CAD realm by understanding the criticality of customer requirements and supplier capabilities, fewer resources will be wasted on failed product launches.  The size and predictability of customer demand will improve by engaging key customer representatives much earlier in the development cycle.	http://salesforcecad.com	CAD, Collaboration, CRM, Enterprise Software, Manufacturing, Software, Web Hosting	George, Iowa, United States	SalesforceCAD focusses on mobilizing a borderless CAD network infrastructure to improve workflow between different CRM, CAD, and PDM tools.	2,026,220

AchieveIt	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/achieveit-online	2010-01-01	year	11-50	In a world where too many of the biggest, most important strategic initiatives get trapped in a spreadsheet, someone has to find a way to transform all that great thinking into great doing.  AchieveIt is the solution organizations use to get their biggest, most important initiatives out of the boardroom and into reality.  We look at ideas and say – Let’s actually do this.™  It all started in 2010, when we were doing strategy consulting for hospitals. Back then we were primarily consultants, with a limited leave-behind software to help track and monitor the plan we had built together.  But over and over, we noticed our clients’ strategic plans were being supported by a bunch of different kinds of plans, with each individual team using their own methods to track and report. What our clients really needed was a way to manage across these integrated plans at the same time, and to be able to see all supporting goals and activities from all their plans, in one view.  So, we supercharged our software and services to help them get everything in view, get everyone engaged, and get every possible advantage. What resulted was an entirely new approach to organizational execution: Integrated Plan Management.  Today, all kinds of organizations turn to AchieveIt for Integrated Plan Management – everyone from utility companies working on new forms of energy, to government agencies looking to reduce taxpayer expenses, to Fortune 500s trying to launch new growth initiatives.  With the growth they’ve accomplished with the help of AchieveIt’s platform and services, these organizations are able to spend 90% of their time actually getting things done – instead of 90% of their time reporting.	https://www.achieveit.com	Business Intelligence, Collaboration, Enterprise Software, Project Management, Software, Task Management	Atlanta, Georgia, United States	AchieveIt is the solution organizations use to get their biggest, most important initiatives out of the boardroom and into reality.	34,574	17,240	12,734.83	64.07%	4,000%	41	1.05	3.77%	97.72%	-1.53%	1,646,359	-482,111	-22.65%

According to the National Association of RealtorsÂ®, homebuyers are now as likely to find their future home online as through their real estate agent. The numerous online home search sites have empowered buyers, but in the process, have distanced them from their most valuable asset, their real estate agent. Real estate agents provide significant guidance through their local market knowledge and experience. With homebuyers searching online and seeing homes independently, it is becoming increasingly difficult for real estate agents to fully share that knowledge and experience. A new approach to real estate, Sliced Simple's social collaboration software enables homebuyers and real estate agents to work seamlessly together.

CloudOptix	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudoptix	2009-05-01	day	51-100	CloudOptix (CO) has developed a personal cloud computing software product called CloudTop, that can be downloaded from their website onto personal computers, notebooks, tablets and smart phones. To ensure privacy and access at the lowest possible cost, CloudTop offers users a comprehensive suite of data storing, sharing and communication cloud apps that use enterprise-class security to access inexpensive public “pay-as-you-go” cloud storage or private “cloud-in-a-box” storage. With a CloudTop users can login to their public cloud storage  accounts (Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Storage, HP Storage, Rackspace Cloud Files, AT&T Synaptics, Nirvanix Storage) and/or private cloud-in-a-box (EMC Atmos, OpenStack Swift, MeghaWare Appliance) to auto slice into secure cloud workspaces and communication channels - for digital lockers, data backups, collaboration and several other use cases. Small business and professional users will find at least one secure cloud app to store or backup their data, or find one to synchronize files, contacts, calendars or notes across their PCs, Tablets or Smart Phones - as well as directly click to view or edit them with the appropriate device-installed apps.  Or choose a cloud app for creating a private work, play or social network and with a free invitee app link invite others to share files, post or pin content; email, instant message, collaborate or socialize in absolute privacy – as well as stay connected with them via public social networks, email, IM, etc. All CloudTop transactions are secured with vendor independent AES-256 encryption, including data stored on any MeghaWare cloud appliances used for local storage or caching - not using third party encryption or servers ensures data privacy from loss or theft and availability during service outages. With support for pay-as-you-go accounts and one-click migration or deletion, CloudTop users can shop around for free storage offers and the lowest monthly subscription fees from 7 industry leading providers – rent at will for pennies per month ($0 if unused) and save by paying per GB (used).  With support for cloud-in-a-box caching and storing, monthly subscription fees can be driven down to the bone or completely eliminated. Also, savings dramatically go up with the number of free invitee apps used, when compared to fees charged for every user by other cloud or traditional app vendors. Industry veterans Shawn Nagar and Leo Salazar came up with the idea of MeghaWare - personal cloud computing software - in early 2009, drawing on their experience in designing high performance computers (at DEC), creating a storage-networking company (acquired by EMC) and a storage-virtualization company (acquired by VMware). Ashish Nagar joined the founding team in January 2010, to head product engineering in India.   MeghaWare is a registered trademark and brand name for CO's cloud computing family of software products. CloudTop is a registered trademark and brand name of their flagship product.  CO is a privately held software company founded in May, 2009. Primarily focused on the front-end of cloud computing, it has developed virtual cloud computing software. Sold as the MeghaWare CloudTop, it offers users their own suite of cloud computing applications and a personal cloud created from virtually connecting their public and private cloud storage accounts. They are headquartered in Boca Raton, FL. They have R&D centers in Massachusetts, Texas and California. Their Product Engineering and Technical Support offices are located in India.	http://www.meghaware.com	Cloud Computing, Cloud Management, Collaboration, Cyber Security, Logistics, Privacy, Software	Boca Raton, Florida, United States	CloudOptix is a Personal Cloud Computing.	221,837

P2P-Next	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/p2p-next	2008-02-01	day	11-50	"P2P-Next, created by the founders of Tribler,  is a pan-European conglomerate of 21 industrial partners, media content providers and research institutions. They are building a [""next-generation"" P2P client](http://torrentfreak.com/eu-invests-22-million-in-next-generation-bittorrent-client/) and announced a €15 million grant from the European Union in February 2008. Another €4 million is donated by 21 project partners, including the BBC. P2P-Next will develop an open source, efficient, trusted, personalized, user-centric and participatory television and media delivery mechanism with social and collaborative connotations using the emerging P2P paradigm, which takes into account the existing EU legal framework. From the company: _""The P2P-Next project will run over four years, and plans to conduct a large-scale technical trial of new media applications running on a wide range of consumer devices. If successful, this ambitious project could create a platform that would enable audiences to stream and interact with live content via a PC or set top box. In addition, it is our intention to allow audiences to build communities around their favourite content via a fully personalized system.  This technology could potentially be built into VOD services in the future and plans are underway to test the system for broadcasting the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest live online. We will have an open approach towards sharing results. All core software technology will be available as open source, enabling new business models. P2P-Next will also address a number of outstanding challenges related to content delivery over the internet, including technical, legal, regulatory, security, business and commercial issues.""_ The P2P-Next integrated project will build a next generation Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content delivery platform, to be designed, developed, and applied jointly by a consortium consisting of high-profile academic and industrial players with proven track records in innovation and commercial success. The current infrastructure of the Internet is not suited to simultaneous transmission of live events to millions of people (i.e. broadcasting). The problem is that a dedicated stream of data must be sent to every single user. With millions of potential users, the simultaneous streams of data will easily congest the Internet. For several years, we have been told that the answer to this problem is ""multicasting"", whereby the data stream is distributed to many local servers that subsequently ""re-broadcast"" the content to local users. However, most IP routers of the Internet cannot support multicasting—and there seems to be no financial incentive for the ISPs to introduce multicasting. Also, the use of Audiovisual Media is moving from a collective and passive approach to personal active behavior, at home and in mobile situations outside the home. At the same time use patterns are shifting towards non-linear usages, moving away from the classic model of linear broadcast TV. The TV set no longer has the monopoly of delivery of audiovisual content; the PC and related media centers, mobile phones, and potentially initiatives from new stakeholders are all becoming increasingly important. In such heterogeneous environments, efficient content delivery needs optimized unicast, multicast, broadcast, and also support for new mechanisms that have been made possible by the recent advances in P2P grids. This situation has important consequences for the existing business models and institutions, as well as for content production, content distribution, and end user experience on various terminals. This particular holds for stakeholders that propose services based on heterogeneous terminals and networks, together with the demand from users of transparent service continuity. This makes Peer-to-Peer -based technologies that can provide efficient and low-cost delivery of professional and user created content essential for the technologically-competitive future Europe. In response to these challenges, the objective of P2P-Next is to move forward the technical enablers to facilitate new business scenarios for the complete value chain in the content domain from a linear unidirectional push mode to a user centric, time and place independent platform paradigm. A platform approach allows modular development and modular applications, enables knowledge sharing and facilitates technology integration, code- and skill re-use. This translates to fast development of new content delivery applications that build value for service and content providers. P2P-Next will develop a platform that takes open source development, open standards, and future proof iterative integration as key design principles. These requirements will be developed through collaboration with European and national initiatives, as well as some of the largest and most sophisticated actors in the media and telecommunications sector, ensuring industrial relevance and worldwide application reach. P2P-Next involves 21 partners in 12 different countries, including large European players to ensure the future project's sustainability, SMEs and Subject Matter Experts to manage highly-focused technology components. P2P-Next will advance the state-of-the-art in important areas, including evolutionary content distribution, easy access to vast amount of content with metadata federation, social networking, and innovative business models for advertising. The sum of these advances is a large step towards moving the information access from the hands of a producer to the hands of the consumer, and allowing consumers to enjoy and utilise content resources in a mobile and pervasive manner, across the great online space."	http://www.p2p-next.org	Collaboration, Open Source, Software	Tampere, Western Finland, Finland	P2P Next provides open source, participatory media delivery mechanisms with social and collaborative connotations using the P2P paradigm.	638,312

All files to be shared then go directly to the recipients, without being sent via third party servers over the internet.

Lotus is most commonly known for the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet application, the first feature-heavy, user friendly, reliable and WYSIWYG-enabled product to become widely available in the early days of the IBM PC, when there was no Graphical User Interface. Such a useful tool certainly helped to spread the adoption of the PC, both for administrative and scientific applications. Much later, in conjunction with Ray Ozzie's Iris Associates, Lotus also released a groupware and email system, Lotus Notes. IBM purchased the company in 1995 for $3.5 billion, primarily to acquire Lotus Notes and to establish a presence in the increasingly important client-server computing segment, which was rapidly making host-based products like IBM's OfficeVision obsolete.

Teleshuttle	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/teleshuttle	1994-07-01	month	1-10	"Teleshuttle researches and develops the innovations of founder Richard Reisman, in collaboration with partner companies.  These innovations are driven by a user-centered focus on empowering people – applying powerful interactive tools and media for communication, collaboration, culture, and commerce.  Teleshuttle has multiple patent portfolios in development, and over 200 companies have licensed one or more of these patents, including licenses for use by nearly every major provider of smartphones and many major companies in TV/video.  Much of Teleshuttle's current work is pro-bono, with focus on FairPay. Areas of activity include: --FairPay - An entirely new concept of what a price is and why -- an architecture for efficiently pricing digital content/services in the context of an ongoing relationship. FairPay is based on customer dialogs about value, and develops a buyer reputation based on Internet feedback, to go beyond ""freemium,"" to a far more efficient and dynamically adaptive hybrid of free and paid offerings.  FairPay was presented 12/1/11 at an MIT Enterprise Forum of NYC symposium on ""Better Strategies for Monetizing Digital Offerings,"" and on the HBR Blog on 11/18/13. Teleshuttle is working on a pro-bono basis with industry and academic partners on research, trials, and applications of FairPay, and offers free consultation services.   --CoTV - Coactive TV – provides a rich platform for the growing trend toward multi-screen viewing and simultaneous, or “coactive,” use of TV and the Web.  CoTV creates a powerful new compound medium that fully maintains the best of both (and works with ordinary TVs and PCs/tablets/phones as companion devices) – while riding the trend toward user-centered media multitasking in the wireless, networked home.  Fifteen Reisman CoTV-related patents have issued, with more allowed or pending.  These patents were licensed to RPX Corporation member companies as of 3/10/15.   --Search and the Social Web and Semantic Web (Sold) - A portfolio including seven patents issued in 2005-2014, with others pending.  Sold 7/6/09 to RPX Corporation, the first defensive patent aggregator.     --Internet push distribution and software update (Sold) - In the early 1990s, Teleshuttle developed a patent portfolio that was later licensed to BTG International for commercialization.  This portfolio includes nineteen patents awarded in 1997-2014.  BTG's licensing efforts led to patent infringement suits against Microsoft and Apple. On 3/31/06, BTG announced the sale of these patent rights for $35 million, plus a share of future profits, and that BTG and Teleshuttle would no longer pursue those suits.  These patents and continuing license efforts are controlled by Intellectual Ventures.   Other patent portfolios in development relate to such areas as  --Big Data and The Internet of Things -- data exchange for smart, connected products, including usage data and ratings,  --Digital media storage and asset management, and  --The Idea Adoption Agency (including advanced methods for collaboration and reputation management). Consulting clients have included News Corporation/TVGuide, Dow Jones/Telerate, Euro RSCG/MVBMS, HealthScout/RxRemedy, AppliedTheory Communications, and BTG International, as well as Intellectual Ventures, RPX Corporation, and other prominent companies in the Intellectual Property space. (Teleshuttle is not seeking paid consulting work, but does selectively offer consulting on FairPay without fee.) Teleshuttle was founded by Richard Reisman in 1994 as an innovative online software/service provider. Reisman is an innovator and thought leader, advancing powerful interactive tools/media for human communication, collaboration, culture, and commerce since long before the Web. His media experience includes developing and marketing CoTV at Teleshuttle, a senior management role at HealthScout.com, leading the design and development of News Corp's original TVGuide Online service through market testing in the early '90s, managing development for Baseline (since acquired by The New York Times), and very early involvements in hypermedia, interactive graphics, and online communities.

Thoughtstar	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thoughtstar	1997-01-01	year	1-10	Teams get things done. Technology gets things done. Successful businesses know it—and know how to make them work together. Thanks to the Internet explosion, it's easier than ever for customers, vendors, and employees to contribute to a project, even if they're far apart. At the same time, technology has made it harder to work together—it just doesn't feel like a team. There are more phone calls, more meetings, more documents delivered—and more holes that appear in critical processes. Some software vendors have attempted to tackle these challenges through groupware products. And while these applications solve communication problems on a company-wide level, they lack the day-to-day management and productivity tools people are desperate for. They just don't work for teams. Enter Thoughtstar. They envisioned a team-focused collaboration tool that could work over the Web. In 1997 they formed their vision into a company called Thoughtstar located in Sandy, Utah. The result of their vision is QuickTeam—an interactive workspace they call a Team Portal where people can go to communicate, collaborate, and add progress to a project. In short, it's a team's on-line headquarters. A whole new way for teams to work—and work more effectively. Today, QuickTeam is the first true—and complete—teamware solution available. You can host it on a corporate intranet, extranet, the Internet or a team member's computer—you can even lease the program from Thoughtstar or your ISP who will host it for you. QuickTeam is all Java, so it works on any platform. And users with no IT experience can install it once and run it over as many computers as necessary, no sweat. Plus, QuickTeam synchs up with the top groupware products a company may already have, making them more effective. And, it's got all the productivity tools your team needs to be more efficient—and more effective.

GSX products began because we all had first hand systems administration experience and suffered from a lack of proactive monitoring tools. Enhancing and expanding the tools we built to solve that problem, we created solutions with your IT communications administration in mind: As administrators, we had to wait for a maintenance window on servers to simply install some code. This is not the case with GSX Monitor which has no resident code. The entire solution can be rolled out in one hour and will not consume important server processing capacity which has to be reserved for end-user applications. We understand that you are not working on one single platform but a multitude of them. This is why we have ensured that all of your servers could be monitored from one single interface: Notes, Exchange, Sharepoint, BlackBerry Enterprise Server, Sametime, Quickr, Traveler, URLs. Once your team has control over one environment, extending it to another one is simple and natural. We provide complementary tools designed for both the administrators who need to identify issues and take remedial actions (GSX Server Guard), as well as the managers who need to get regular consistent reports to ensure that ovreall Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are being met (GSX Analyzer). Software quality and customer satisfaction are essential. We take great pride in our extensive and rigorous testing before a product release – and we take equal pride in our customers response.

Valueworks	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/valueworks	2000-01-01	year	11-50	Social landlords spend large sums on their capital works, and they hold a wealth of data in their housing, asset management and finance systems.  But this data is often gathered and stored on spreadsheets, so landlords struggle to turn its potential into insight for better management decision-making. Worse still, they lose auditable control over the cost and quality of their capital works, and get caught up in commercial disputes with their contractors and suppliers. Valueworks provides a shared collaborative software platform that gives landlords visibility into clean data, and control over the cost and quality of their capital works; while their contractors and suppliers receive well-structured programs of work -  reducing the number of disputes and ensuring they remain a supplier of choice.  Delivered as a service for a fixed monthly cost, our software integrates with all major housing, asset and finance systems, and a typical implementation takes no longer than five weeks. Our customers include Home Group, Flintshire County Council and Sutton Housing Partnership.

Once the discussion is taking place people can key in their comments under each agenda item.  At the end of the call a pdf version of the notes can be printed out or emailed.

Hub Culture	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/hub-culture	2002-11-01	day	11-50	Hub Culture is a global collaboration service anchored by the Ven digital currency.  The company operates physical locations  trading in Ven and manages a micropayment platform for content, groups, products, services and events. Hub Culture is a leader in P2P exchange, commodity trading, M2M/AI exchange and virtual financial services. It was founded in November 2002. The Hub Culture group of companies is privately held with offices in Bermuda, Geneva, Hong Kong, London, San Francisco and New York. Dedicated representatives are in over 60 locations worldwide. The site has been noted in the Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Wired, PSFK, Harvard Business Review, CNNMoney, Forbes, WSJ, Finextra, Bloomberg and other financial media. In 2008, Hub Culture began developing Pavilions, member based workspaces in key cities offering coworking, concierge and consulting services, meeting space, and online collaboration tools on an internet based technology platform. Hub Culture Pavilions, both temporary and permanent, have appeared in London, Copenhagen, Cannes, Beijing, New York City, Los Angeles, Ibiza, Rio de Janeiro, Durban, Ho Chi Minh City, Cancun and other locations.  As of July 2013, Hub Culture lists over 25,000 members and has exchanged over 20 million units of Ven. The currency is priced from a basket of currencies, commodities and carbon, and floats against other major currencies at floating exchange rates. In a partnership with Thomson Reuters, Ven became the first virtual currency available in the financial markets, with realtime exchange rates available on <.VEN> on over 500,000 trading terminals worldwide. Ven first appeared as an application in Facebook on 4 July, 2007.

In 2010 Ven added Carbon to its basket components, alongside multiple currencies and commodities, making it the first green currency, with a theoretical carbon offset attached to each transaction.

PMOD Technologies	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pmod-technologies	2003-01-01	year		The PMOD software has origins dating back to 1993, when PET was mainly a research tool. For lack of software, development of quantification tools was started at the University Hospital PET Center in Zurich. Soon, there was an interest in the PET community to adopt the programs. Therefore, in collaboration with engineers from Warsaw University of Technology, the software was brought into industrial-grade quality, and distributed to numerous leading PET sites in the world. Based on their feedback, scope and functionality were improved, resulting in a suite of tools covering the diverse needs of researchers in the field of molecular imaging. Due to the wide adaptation of PMOD in the field, support of the project within the University became difficult. Therefore, PMOD Technologies LLC was founded in 2003 as a spin-off of the Zurich PET Center to further develop and distribute the PMOD software. Since then, the customer base has massively grown, now comprising more than 550 sites with over 1000 active users worldwide. In parallel, functionality has been markedly extended, reaching into the neighboring domains of functional MRI and CT. Vibrant collaborations with various flagship institutions ensure that their PMOD software remains leading-edge. They aim to equip researchers with best-in-class software quantification tools for biomedical imaging in humans and animals, and to back them up in their experimental work by outstanding support and services.	http://www.pmod.com	Collaboration, Information Technology, Software	Zürich, Zurich, Switzerland	PMOD Technologies has aim to equip researchers with best-in-class software quantification tools for biomedical imaging in humans & animals.	503,828	3,948	4,482.17	-22.66%	1,523.53%	0	1.01	-48.85%	99.09%	31.73%	3,777,766	400,401	11.86%

MyOnlineToolbox addresses the fundamental need for automation and gains efficiency for an industry predominantly running its business on pen, paper, napkin and drywall.    Because the product is software-as-a-service, all our clients need is an Internet connection.  The start-up is easy and affordable.

The B2C part provides contractors a means to offer estimates, scheduling updates and invoices to homeowners.   The current economic environment is providing a unique opportunity to capture market share.  For example, digital media companies relying primarily on advertising for revenue are facing a tough outlook.  Ad dollars are not flowing as rapidly to the Internet as they were.

New construction is predominantly grounded for the near future, especially when so many homes are within a foreclosure process and there is an abundance of available homes on the market.  This leads to a perfect opportunity to capitalize on an evolving market of home repair and remodeling.

The fully-integrated tools make it easy for a team of software developers to collaborate while working anywhere in the world. The management team can monitor the progress and communicate with the programmers using the Devizan management tools. The software deployment and maintenance are designed to be fast and efficient. With its emphasis on transparency, Devizan includes management tools that aren't available in traditional IDEs. The management team can look at the development project at any point in time, and view the changes that were made during the development and maintenance phases. Without relying upon old-fashioned screenshots or keyboard logs, Devizan delivers management-level information about all the changes that have been made to the system under development. Managers can stay as close to the development effort as they choose. Devizan can alert the management team every time a change is made. The task lists, built-in chat system, and status updates keep managers in the loop. The management team can preview all changes before deployment, examine the revision control documents, and call for a rollback of the code if they are not satisfied with the quality of the program release. Devizan features a web-based integrated development environment (IDE) that makes software development collaborative. The IDE supports syntax highlighting, multi-cursor collaborative editing, and built-in FTP for fast and easy uploads. The IDE is browser-based, and includes linear revision controls and edit history. Unlike traditional version-control systems that require checking programs in and out, Devizan lets all developers work in the current copy of the source code. The integration regimen makes it easy to see where one programmer left off and another programmer began. The software's preview function makes it simple to test changes to the code, and back the revised code out if a problem is detected. Devizan uses Amazon AWS servers housed in highly secure data centers. The environment can be customized to fit each Devizan user's needs. Resources are fully scalable, so Devizan users pay for only the resources that they use. The starter rate for a managed development environment with support of up to 10 users costs $15(US) per month. The 100-user plan costs $200 per month. Subscription costs include software updates, technical support, shared hosting costs, bandwidth, and system administration.	http://www.devizan.com	Collaboration, Software	Pasadena, California, United States	Devizan delivers transparent cloud software solutions that aid in development, management, and deployment of websites.	1,488,837
