One of the key ingredients includes a semantic layer as ultra-scalable and generic platform and graphical modeling tools as a basis for the development of a completely new dimension of standard business software (""SaaS-based software services""). Innovative element of the NETBRIDGE technology is the semantic, accelerated by graphics cards integration platform as well as the graphical modeling tools as a basis for the development of a new dimension of standard business software. The platform and the applications are based on modern frameworks and programming languages where it is extremely flexible and tailorable to each business processes. Due to the smart architecture and consistent SaaS approach, the development times and efforts are up to 70% shorter. Customers benefit from up to 60% shorter project duration and implementation efforts. The introduction of the semantic rule-layer simultaneously enables risk-free integration of existing software solutions - and thus the maximum investment protection for businesses - as well as the gradual replacement of legacy enterprise software by NETBRIDGE Business Suites. To solve the performance problems of today's ERP and data warehousing solutions cost-effectively, the company is one of the first providers to accelerated by graphics cards in-memory computing approach. Much faster and more flexible access to transactional data and mathematical calculations enable analytical reports on-the-fly. With NETBRIDGE it is the first time that transactional OLTP and analytical calculations OLAP are fully available at the same time and create flexible data queries without knowledge of the underlying data models.  Similar to what Google does with indices on websites and relevance sorting through PageRank, with this new technology based on superior computing power, the intelligent data model and the direct access to customer raw data, indexing of all files of the customer across systems and to do this automatically. In this way, the foundation stone for the parallel semantic data integration and migration is placed. Unlike today's data warehouse solutions dynamic queries and create customized BI reports in real time are possible at any time. The software which is based on web technologies (HTML5) was aligned from day one to mobile usage and adopts automatically to each device (responsive device). Thanks to the graphical specification language BPMN 2.0 business processes can flexibly and individually displayed and changes are quickly adjusted to the Business Suites. Software modifications are reduced to a minimum or eliminated completely. Gesture-controlled shortcuts also allow features that are unrealizable on the desktop. Through a platform API, partners and developers can use the full functionality of NETBRIDGE and develop discrete Business Suites. Technology, data model and architecture of NETBRIDGE already meet high demands on ERP solutions of the next generation, and thus the re-quirements for a best-in-class IT architecture: An ultra-scalable and fully integrated platform, Private-, hybrid and public cloud management, semantic, and Big Data-enabled technologies as well as a 512-bit encryption that goes beyond today's 128-bit standard addition. As a result, the customer benefits from extremely high performance, flexibility and safety as well as enormous cost savings."

MediaSilo	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mediasilo	When video workflows operate like a well-oiled machine, teams can stop worrying about security and focus on producing better content, faster and more efficiently. MediaSilo is a video management platform for distributed media production teams that need to manage, share and approve content safely and easily. The Boston, MA-based company works with media companies, advertising agencies and content creators to provide lightweight SaaS software that sits in the middle of video lifecycles, working with existing tools and workflows to keep teams connected, assets secure and stories beautifully and seamlessly presented. With 550+ customers, 100k+ monthly users and 10M+ assets managed, MediaSilo continues to innovate and provide solutions that span media, entertainment and enterprise video, with a focus on security.  Most recently, MediaSilo launched SafeStream, an on-demand watermarking technology that acts as a visual deterrant to piracy. Each watermarked video is created in real-time and is personalized to the person requesting or viewing the asset.  Because the customized watermark is inserted in near real-time (less than a 20-second delay) – even for a 90-minute video – the speed and cost-effectiveness of SafeStream is unheard of the industry, and is not interruptive to the viewing experience. The content owner remains in complete control of where and how the watermark appears on the video.  It can be incorporated directly into workflows so it can be easily used to protect dailies and rough cuts in addition to finished content.

CAST AI	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cast-ai	CAST AI is a cloud optimization platform that reduces cloud costs, optimizes DevOps, and automates disaster recovery. CAST AI intelligent optimization engine delivers a cost-efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructure for every Kubernetes workload.  Cloud Cost optimization  CAST AI brings resource and cost optimization to Kubernetes using an AI-driven optimization engine that applies cluster changes based on real-time workload conditions. It selects the most cost-effective instance types and bin-packs pods for maximum utilization. The platform uses spot instances that offer 70 to 90% discounts and are automatically selected for any stateless workloads. CAST AI also sets pod scaling parameters to achieve optimal application performance while maximizing cost savings. Moreover, users get detailed cost reports to enable forecasting expenses at the level of project, cluster, namespace, and deployment - down to individual microservices. Infrastructure abstraction that makes DevOps 10x more productive CAST AI provides an opinionated Kubernetes implementation that hides the infrastructure complexities with automation. So DevOps engineers no longer have to deal with IaaS complexity and can finally focus on higher-order cloud-native abstractions and concepts. They can create and manage CAST AI components through API, CLI, and Terraform to automate their infrastructure lifecycle management. CAST AI also provides services for in-cluster observability (logging, tracing, and metrics) and built-in security (encryption at rest and in transit). Foolproof outage prevention with cloud neutrality, multi-cloud and multi-region capabilities CAST AI protects workloads against downtime with a Disaster Avoidance strategy based on cloud neutrality and multi-cloud capabilities. To achieve 100% uptime, CAST AI adopts the active approach to Disaster Recovery by stretching applications and data across multiple clouds so that a cloud failure never becomes a disaster. Underlying all of our technology is a custom multi-cloud networking layer that makes the magic happen.

Quobyte	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/quobyte	Quobyte is software that turns commodity servers into a unified, high performance, scalable software storage system. It runs on any x86 server and utilizes commodity HDDs, SSDs, and NVMes of your choice. Data silos are eliminated through unified, multi-interface access with common authentication and ACLs. Designed on the same principles that allow Google to run vast amounts of storage continuously, Quobyte scales to thousands of clients, servers, volumes, and tenants. Storage nodes can be added live, eliminating reconfiguration downtime, and client systems can immediately make use of the added resources.   Quobyte was founded in 2013 by former Google employees Felix Hupfeld and Björn Kolbeck. Both had already gathered more than seven years of experience in distributed and storage systems research at the Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB), developing the parallel file system XtreemFS.

Pixeom	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pixeom	Pixeom’s platform recreates and orchestrates cloud functionality on-premise, making it easy to deploy and manage large-scale, geographically distributed infrastructure and workloads. It is an enterprise-ready technology that meets the stringent requirements of our dozens of Fortune 500 customers and because Pixeom is agnostic, we can deploy edge infrastructure that runs on any hardware, any operating system, and connects to any cloud. Pixeom addresses one of the most challenging issues facing today’s enterprises – distributed edge deployment at scale. IT Admins can’t be sent out to thousands or millions of locations in a cost effective and timely manner. Only software and automation can address this problem, and we’ve done it in a way that makes the migration from cloud to edge completely seamless. With Pixeom, your existing cloud-native application doesn’t need to be re-architected for it to run on the edge. Once deployed, we offer a growing number of “edge versions” of popular cloud services such as machine learning or stream processing that have been recreated to match the APIs on-premise.

Airtame	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airtame	Airtame is a small wireless HDMI device that plugs into the HDMI port of any screen or projector. Unlike other wireless HDMI devices, nothing is plugged into your computer or smartphone. Simply download our app and stream your content to the screen from any major computer platform, tablet, or smartphone. When you connect it to a WiFi network, everyone can connect to the Airtame too. We think that’s pretty cool. And when no one is streaming to the TV, you can set the default display to show a website or dashboard for something functional, like sales numbers, or just to show something pretty, like your company logo. But that’s just what it does now. We have a very ambitious plan for a wireless future.

Garden	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/garden-io	Garden is a Kubernetes testing platform for every step of the development process.  The widespread adoption of cloud native technologies such as containers and Kubernetes has made it easier than ever to operate and scale applications. But important developer workflows have been overlooked or neglected along the way. Many developers find that they’re now less productive than they were before the cloud native era. Testing is a critical part of the development process and one that’s in need of a major upgrade. Modern cloud native testing practices are largely driven by what’s feasible rather than what’s useful. Developers working on distributed microservices applications have been left without an efficient way to build, run tests, and troubleshoot in a production-like environment. Garden makes it easy to spin up ephemeral testing and preview environments for integration tests, manual QA, and development. With Garden, developers get fast feedback exactly when they need it, and DevOps teams are no longer bogged down with provisioning and managing ad hoc environments.

Rely.io	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/detech-ai	detech.ai provides a unified modern AIOps platform that turns your data into actionable insights to help you detect & resolve issues proactively. When your online services hiccup, customers go elsewhere. And if your experts are constantly reacting to incidents after they happen, your innovation and agility will plummet. In order to remain competitive and grow, you need seamless operations. However, organisations generate amounts of data that humans simply cannot monitor effectively, therefore AIOps is critical to reduce and manage IT incidents.  Our platform autonomously learns the normal behaviour of your applications, accurately detecting anomalies and alerting the right people to address only the problems that need addressing. This will allow you to resolve issues before they impact the business, while freeing people to focus on innovating.

Wyconn	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wyconn	"Wyconn’s products for OEMs, enterprises, and telecom companies combine the functions of a router, access point, firewall, and gateway and include embedded global SIMs, all managed through a web-based management console.  The design of this hardware-software solution lowers the cost and time required for large-scale deployments to connect people, sensors, machines, and organizations. The radically simpler approach to the design of Wyconn’s products combines the simplicity of installing modern consumer products with the web-based tools large enterprises, telecoms, and service providers need to manage devices that number in the hundreds of thousands.   In addition, Wyconn devices run applications that can be deployed, managed, and updated centrally.  Standard applications available now include Wyconn Router Companion, pairing a Wyconn device with a remote router or switch for out-of-band management, and Wyconn Branch Connector for enterprises, retail chains, and distributed services companies. Background The company’s products were first introduced at the 2014 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona:  ""As connectivity service provider we use remote device management for millions of customers' internet access devices on a daily basis. With Wyconn we can offer this functionality to our enterprise customers. From SMEs to large corporations, their IT managers, administrators and system integrators can now easily access and manage their network devices, even when there is no WAN connection available."" said Richard Palmetzhofer, Managing Director for sales at Telekom Austria Group M2M. ""We are impressed by Wyconn's approach to reduce installation complexity and costs through the built in SIMs and the cloud-based management platform, and are looking forward to partnering with them during the roll-out across Europe.""  Wyconn is a member of the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC):  “The Industrial Internet Consortium was founded as an international organization and we’re excited that Wyconn has signed on as one of our first European members,” said Dr. Richard Soley, Executive Director of the IIC. “Wyconn understands the practical challenges with large-scale deployments and we look forward to leveraging their expertise as we continue to accelerate the growth of the Industrial Internet.” Wyconn will participate in the IIC quarterly meeting in Boston June 18 – 19, 2014.  This fall the company will participate in CTIA’s Super Mobility Week (September 9 – 11, 2014) in Las Vegas and will present at M2M Innovation World Congress in Marseille (September 22 – 24, 2014)."

Creole Studios	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/creole-studios	Creole Studios is a young web, mobile and cloud app development agency in Hong Kong and India. We build mobile apps in iOS & Android platforms, and web apps & cloud apps in a variety of modern web technologies. We are a one-stop shop for all things related to creating mobile apps or building web products. Right from conceptualising the idea of the app to its app-store submission and everything in between and even after- all is taken care of at our studio. This leaves you with a lot of time to plan the execution strategy, carry out the deployment groundwork and set up the marketing campaign. We work hard and break our backs to create something that we believe in, something that helps people, something that outlives us. As a team, we are a very diverse bunch of folks. We belong to different disciplines of education and work. But what unites us all as a team is our unwavering set of principles which allow us to create everything with a deep sense of conviction. After all, having a set of heroes like Steve Jobs, Muhammad Ali, Marie Curie, Ayrton Senna, Saul Bass, Andy Warhol - does make you a bit quirky. It is an interesting mix. Thus, growing this team and flourishing the studio has been a labour of love. As the team size increased, we wanted the same original vibe to be carried on throughout the team and so far everything is going pretty much as planned on that tissue paper in Starbucks (Oh yes, we have that clichéd story).

Authentic8	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/authentic8	The browser has become one of the most important tools on the desktop, but the browser’s ubiquity makes it the leading target of exploit. Users connect from untrusted devices over insecure networks; corrupted websites plant malicious code; spoofed URLs are clicked; and credentials are entered into phishing forms. All of this leads to management challenges and risk to sensitive data and resources. Authentic8 Silo is a secure, virtual browser in the cloud designed to insulate and isolate web data. Silo is built fresh on launch and executes all web code in a secure sandbox. Users connect via a secure RDP connection, giving full interactivity of web sites while creating a perfect insulation layer between the device and the web. And when the session ends, the virtual instance is destroyed - zero forensic residue remains on the client device. Authentic8, Inc. is headquartered in Mountain View, California.

Given the flood of photos that consumers have spread across multiple services, AnyCloud provides a central portal that helps them save time and enjoy their photos more with family and friends.  The AnyCloud team has deep expertise in managing distributed services through centralized portals within companies like Fanfare, SkyPilot, and Turnstone. The team understands the complexities of deep API integration with 3rd-party services, knows how to build and scale cloud services, and has experience with exposing APIs to external developers. To complement the team, AnyCloud has recruited an advisory board from companies like Mint, LimeLife, and Lemon with significant experience in consumer customer acquisition, partnerships, and branding. AnyCloud has five provisional patents already filed to provide “credential brokering”, which allows users to share and transfer content between online services. AnyCloud is the only software-only company that is poised to provide consumers with an easy-to-use and elegant solution to managing and mastering the flood of digital photos from across their connected life. Given that the AnyCloud service does not actually store content but instead acts as a software bridge and portal across services, AnyCloud operates strictly as a cloud software company.

Most organizations focus on transforming their core & customer facing systems as part of digital transformation. One of the critical pieces that’s often over-looked is consumption management – How efficiently products and services are consumed within an enterprise. This is a key element to unlock enterprise agility and enhance user experience. Consumption in most enterprises today is sub-optimal with lack of standardized & productized approach, sourcing based on inputs vs outcomes, broken processes and multiple manual touch points leading to longer fulfilment times and dissatisfied customers.

CloudOptix	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cloudoptix	CloudOptix (CO) has developed a personal cloud computing software product called CloudTop, that can be downloaded from their website onto personal computers, notebooks, tablets and smart phones. To ensure privacy and access at the lowest possible cost, CloudTop offers users a comprehensive suite of data storing, sharing and communication cloud apps that use enterprise-class security to access inexpensive public “pay-as-you-go” cloud storage or private “cloud-in-a-box” storage. With a CloudTop users can login to their public cloud storage  accounts (Amazon S3, Microsoft Azure, Google Storage, HP Storage, Rackspace Cloud Files, AT&T Synaptics, Nirvanix Storage) and/or private cloud-in-a-box (EMC Atmos, OpenStack Swift, MeghaWare Appliance) to auto slice into secure cloud workspaces and communication channels - for digital lockers, data backups, collaboration and several other use cases. Small business and professional users will find at least one secure cloud app to store or backup their data, or find one to synchronize files, contacts, calendars or notes across their PCs, Tablets or Smart Phones - as well as directly click to view or edit them with the appropriate device-installed apps.  Or choose a cloud app for creating a private work, play or social network and with a free invitee app link invite others to share files, post or pin content; email, instant message, collaborate or socialize in absolute privacy – as well as stay connected with them via public social networks, email, IM, etc. All CloudTop transactions are secured with vendor independent AES-256 encryption, including data stored on any MeghaWare cloud appliances used for local storage or caching - not using third party encryption or servers ensures data privacy from loss or theft and availability during service outages. With support for pay-as-you-go accounts and one-click migration or deletion, CloudTop users can shop around for free storage offers and the lowest monthly subscription fees from 7 industry leading providers – rent at will for pennies per month ($0 if unused) and save by paying per GB (used).  With support for cloud-in-a-box caching and storing, monthly subscription fees can be driven down to the bone or completely eliminated. Also, savings dramatically go up with the number of free invitee apps used, when compared to fees charged for every user by other cloud or traditional app vendors. Industry veterans Shawn Nagar and Leo Salazar came up with the idea of MeghaWare - personal cloud computing software - in early 2009, drawing on their experience in designing high performance computers (at DEC), creating a storage-networking company (acquired by EMC) and a storage-virtualization company (acquired by VMware). Ashish Nagar joined the founding team in January 2010, to head product engineering in India.   MeghaWare is a registered trademark and brand name for CO's cloud computing family of software products. CloudTop is a registered trademark and brand name of their flagship product.  CO is a privately held software company founded in May, 2009. Primarily focused on the front-end of cloud computing, it has developed virtual cloud computing software. Sold as the MeghaWare CloudTop, it offers users their own suite of cloud computing applications and a personal cloud created from virtually connecting their public and private cloud storage accounts. They are headquartered in Boca Raton, FL. They have R&D centers in Massachusetts, Texas and California. Their Product Engineering and Technical Support offices are located in India.

StorPool	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/storpool	StorPool is a leading software provider that develops the most reliable and speedy storage platform on the market. Public and private cloud builders - Managed Services Providers, Hosting Services Providers, Cloud Services Providers, enterprises, and SaaS vendors - use StorPool Storage as the foundation for their clouds. StorPool converts sets of standard servers into primary storage systems for large-scale cloud infrastructure. The software comes as an utterly hands-off solution - we architect, deploy, tune, monitor, and maintain your StorPool Storage system so that your users experience a speedy and reliable service. StorPool Storage systems are ideal for storing and managing the data of primary workloads that demand extreme reliability and low latency - databases, web servers, virtual desktops, real-time analytics, and mission-critical software. StorPool simplifies our customers’ cloud infrastructure, removes all the pains they experienced with legacy storage products, and supercharges their revenue and profits. Our customers’ specific benefits from StorPool Storage vary depending on their use cases, technology stacks, and scale. However, the core capabilities of StorPool are that it is reliable, agile, managed with ease, utterly hands-off, and speedy. Under the hood, StorPool builds out shared-storage pools out of DC-grade storage drives directly attached to standard servers to create the ultimate storage solution. These pools provide standard block device interfaces to the virtualised, containerised, or bare-metal workloads running in a cloud. StorPool has native plug-ins for Cloud Management Platforms like OpenStack, OpenNebula, CloudStack, Kubernetes, and OnApp. It also supports VMware, Oracle VM, Hyper-V, XenServer, and almost all other technology stacks. We designed StorPool Storage for large-scale deployments, but it has efficient resource consumption and can start small. Each cluster scales seamlessly online - adding drives or servers expands both its capacity and performance. Adjusting StorPool volume size and performance also happens online without disrupting user workloads. The updates for StorPool are also carried out online, without any interruptions to your services. StorPool doesn’t need specialised hardware components to deliver all of the above.

BitDust	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bitdust	BitDust is a distributed on-line storage, in which only owner has an access to the data. Imagine a situation when two friends and you agree to help each other to store the data. On your computer you store the data that both of your friends uploaded to you via Internet, and you in turn can use the free space on their machines to save your files. This creates redundancy, but allows storing important data in a safer way. It is also a fair deal, because all three are interested in the maximum safety and availability of stored information. BitDust network is a voluntary association of people sharing resources of their personal computers. Their machines run the same copies of BitDust program, which enables all device communications. The data are transmitted from one user to another and stored on user hard disk drives.  BitDust also protects your privacy - the software can route the incoming and outgoing traffic via third node, so you can operate anonymously, be independent and safe.

e-Fásli	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/e-fásli	"THE PROBLEM To cool or heat the patient's body part, actually the only solution is the mirelite pea or the salt from the microwave. These solutions initially exert an excessive heat effect and damage the tissues, and after a few minutes are ineffective. If we ask the physician how exactly and how long the treatment will continue, he will not know because it is - in the absence of an appropriate tool - not a wellpublished scientific area. THE SOLUTION Our solution can maintain the set temperature in the range of 25 to 45 degrees Celsius, for hours. The type of disease, its location and the characteristics of the patient can all influence the proper therapy. These features are partially recorded by the patient to the smartphone application, or measured by the device. Collecting the scores of the symptoms from the patient (subjective score) or from the doctor (objective score) the analysis can evaluate the optimal treatment. WORK WE HAVE DONE SO FAR We have constructed the device to be enough strong for a continous work. It is wearable (WiFi connection, batteries) and there are multiple peripheral unitsts for different body parts. The central part is common, it is connected to the peripheral part by a cable and a plug. The GUI is highly customizable, depending on the gender, the age and the nationality of the user. The next step is to check the specifications for used materials and operating parameters. WHAT MAKES OUR SOLUTION INNOVATIVE Currently, the device has no alternative. Based on the patent, this can be the first therapeutic tool to develop itself by collecting and analyzing data. The control panel is a smartphone app, so it can be always up-to-date and it can advertise personalized supply (e.g. clinics, pharmaceuticals, shops) even in an anonimous environment. There are no sensitive data (like email, phone Nr or name) stored about the patients. The device GUI is password protected. DESCRIPTION OF USP The innovation has been presented In the Shanghai TV's ""Junior Edison"" competition. This, according to the creators of the show, means 12 million views. This is a great opportunity to introduce the product and to find a manufacturing partner in China (we do not exclude this option). In the first period we plan to sell the basic equipment as a wellness device. Then we can develop a centrallycontrolled, strilizable device for hospital use. THE IP SITUATION The patent (P1700449) is actually approved as a national (Hungarian) patent but it protects the invention for the first year. On this summer we plan to extend the protection to the international level. The only author of this patent is Melinda Szegedi but it was submitted to this startup company as contribution. HOW WE WILL EARN MONEY There is a wide demand for the device. Calculating the appropriate patient groups, the frequency of thermo-therapy and the financial resources of each country, we can state that we have millions of potential buyers. The results of innovation competitions in Hungary, China (and hopefully in America, thanks to the ongoing Intel ISEF competition), provide a great media coverage. Over 10 million people who hear about the invention without any paid marketing activity. IDENTIFIED COMPETITORS We have mapped similar patents and competitors during the patent literature research. The products closest to the present invention are: Wristify, Heated Jacket, Refrigerated Helmets, and pre-hair refinishing caps for chemotherapy. We want to prove our theory about the physiological mechanism of thermo-therapy (called ""immunocyte thermotaxis"") which explains the effectiveness of low energy contact heat conduction therapy."

Opacity	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/opacity	Opacity is a cloud storage provider that enables privacy concerned people to safeguard their online presence by never requiring personal data, using our proprietary cryptocurrency token, OPQ. The OPQ storage payment token doesn't require personal payment information and is used to pay storage providers in the Opacity storage network. The OPQ token is pegged to a value of 64GB of storage, so provides a stable medium of exchange and value over the long term. When a user creates an Opacity account, they receive an Account Handle login. The handle is a similar to a private key derived from a randomly generated mnemonic following the bip39 standard, the standard for crypto wallet software. Uploaded files are client side encrypted and sent in chunks for storage to split the files and improve security. When uploading a file, a File Handle is created as a concatenation of 32 bytes (64 hexchars) of random bytes for the file ID, plus another 32 bytes for the encryption key.  The file is split into 64kb chunks and encrypted with 256bit AES-GCM using the second half of the file handle as the encryption key. The chunks are uploaded to storage providers through Opacity's backend storage nodes.

Memory Lane	https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/memory-lane-2	Vision: Memory Lane reminds users of their lives and histories by using voice computing to experience popular and personal memories stored in the cloud. Mission: Memories make us who we are. As we age, we collect billions of bits of memories. Sometimes, our physical and mental health causes us to lose sight of our memories which causes us to forget who we are. Thanks to easy to use technology like voice computing, we can now access our memories easily, reminding us of the great lives we led and sharing them with the younger generations to come.  Objectives: We empower active aging and longevity using software on voice computing platforms like Amazon’s Alexa to deliver reminiscence therapy. Our application Memory Lane is available for free on the Alexa skill store and uses historic audio clips to take visitors to any year from 1906 to present day. These recordings spark memories about what happened in the user’s life within a given year. Version 2 of Memory Lane will sync to a web interface to enable creation of unique personal memories uploaded by the individual (as a digital diary) or by loved ones who share reminiscences. Strategy: We are enabling voice computing in every room in every senior care facility in America. We can do this by creating a management system for voice computing devices and A.I. applications that provide customize experiences for aging individuals. Caregivers will have the ability to conduct daily tasks with greater ease, set up scheduling tasks and engage in activities. Our flagship product, Memory Lane, is ideal to help bring families closer together around the memories of the aging individual and be used in existing memory care programs throughout the country. Action Plans: We are working with four large organizations in New York and Vermont to pilot the use of Alexa in daily operations and host Memory Lane workshops to keep care-recipients engaged with each other, their caregivers, friends, and families. Our pilot will focus on feedback from caregivers, cognitively healthy seniors, those with early dementia, and then those with dementia.  In 2017, we will develop Memory Lane V2 with subscription and also develop for Google Assistant. We will continue to curate and expand the public Memory Lane library. We are establishing partnerships to run pilot studies in senior assisted living and memory care facilities. We are raising funds to pay our coders and complete our research study on Alexa & aging.
